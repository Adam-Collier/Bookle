<h1 class="chapter-title" id="blu0000302"><?pagebreak number="33"?><a id="p33"/>Chapter Four</h1>
<p class="noindent" id="blu0000303">At two o’clock in the afternoon, Frieda left the room that she rented on the third floor of a mansion block and walked to her house, which was only seven minutes away along back roads that hid behind the arterial routes of the city. Just a few hundred yards away was Oxford Street, with its jostle and noise, but here it was deserted. The muted November light made everything seem grey and still, like a pencil drawing. Past the electrical shop where she bought her light bulbs and fuses, past the twenty-four-hour newsagents, the dimly lit grocers, the low-rise flats.</p>
<p id="blu0000304">Frieda didn’t pause until she reached her house, where she felt the same sense of relief that she always had when coming home, closing the door against the world outside, breathing in the smell of cleanliness and safety. From the moment she had seen it, three years ago, she had known she had to have it, even though it had been neglected for years and had seemed shoddy and misplaced, squeezed between the ugly lock-ups on its left and the council flats on its right. Now, after the work had been done on it, everything was in its place. If she closed her eyes, she would still be able to find each object, even the sharpened pencils on her desk. Here in the hall, the large map of London and the hooks where her belted trench coat hung. Here in the living room, whose window gave out on to the street, the thick-pile rug over the bare boards, the squashy <?pagebreak number="34"?><a id="p34"/>chair and deep sofa on either side of the open fire that she lit each evening, from October through until March. Near the window a chess table, the only item of furniture she had ever inherited. The house was narrow, the width of a single room. Its stairs went steeply up to the first floor, where there was a bedroom and a bathroom, and then even more steeply up to the top floor, which consisted only of her study, with a sloping roof and her desk near the skylight, on which she kept all her drawing things. Reuben called her home her den, or even her lair
(with her as its dragon, keeping people out). It was true that it was dark in here. Lots of people knocked through walls, enlarged windows, let in air and light; Frieda preferred snug, enclosed spaces. She had painted the walls in deep colours, matt reds and bottle greens, so that even in summer the house felt dim, as if it was half underground.</p>
<p id="blu0000305">She picked the letters up from the doormat and put them on the kitchen table without even glancing at them. She never opened her mail in the middle of the day. Sometimes she forgot about it for a week or more until people rang to complain. Nor did she check her answering-machine messages. In fact, it had only been in the last year that she had finally bought an answering machine and she steadfastly refused to have a mobile, to the incredulity of all those around her, who didn’t believe that people could actually function without one. But Frieda wanted to be able to escape from incessant communications and demands. She didn’t want to be at anyone’s beck and call, and she liked cutting herself off from the urgent inanities of the world. When she was on her own, she liked to be truly alone. Out of contact and adrift.</p>
<p id="blu0000306"><?pagebreak number="35"?><a id="p35"/>She had thirty minutes before her next patient. Often she had lunch at her friends’ café in Beech Street, Number 9, but not today. She made herself a quick lunch: toast and Marmite, a few small tomatoes, a cup of tea, an oat biscuit and an apple that she quartered and cored. She took the plate through to the living room and sat in the chair by the fire that she had already laid ready for later. She closed her eyes for a moment and let her tiredness settle inside her, then ate her toast slowly.</p>
<p id="blu0000307">The phone rang. At first she didn’t answer it, but she didn’t have the answering machine turned on, and whoever was on the other end didn’t give up. Finally she picked up.</p>
<p id="blu0000308">‘Frieda. It’s Paz. Is everything all right? Were you in the bath?’</p>
<p id="blu0000309">Frieda sighed. Paz was the administrator at the Warehouse, which wasn’t a warehouse at all. It was a clinic that had relocated to an old warehouse and taken a name that had sounded cutting edge in the early eighties. Frieda had trained there, then worked there and now was on the board. When Paz called her at home, it wasn’t to deliver good news.</p>
<p id="blu0000310">‘No, I wasn’t in the bath. It’s the middle of the day.’</p>
<p id="blu0000311">‘I’d have a bath in the middle of the day if I was at home. Especially on a Monday. I hate Mondays, don’t you?’</p>
<p id="blu0000312">‘Not really.’</p>
<p id="blu0000313">‘Everyone hates Mondays. It’s the low point of the week. When the alarm clock goes off on Monday morning and it’s still dark outside, and you know you have to haul yourself out of bed and begin all over again.’</p>
<p id="blu0000314">‘Did you really ring me to talk about how you hate Mondays?’</p>
<p id="blu0000315"><?pagebreak number="36"?><a id="p36"/>‘Of course not. I wish you’d get yourself a mobile.’</p>
<p id="blu0000316">‘I don’t want a mobile.’</p>
<p id="blu0000317">‘You’re a dinosaur. Are you coming in on Thursday?’</p>
<p id="blu0000318">‘I’m meeting Jack.’ She was supervising Jack’s therapy training.</p>
<p id="blu0000319">‘Could you come in a bit earlier?’ said Paz. ‘We’d like some input.’</p>
<p id="blu0000320">‘I can give you input over the phone. What’s it about?’</p>
<p id="blu0000321">‘Better face to face,’ said Paz.</p>
<p id="blu0000322">‘It’s Reuben, isn’t it?’</p>
<p id="blu0000323">‘Just a little talk. And you and Reuben …’ Her sentence trailed away, leaving a whole history unspoken.</p>
<p id="blu0000324">Frieda bit her lip, imagining what was going on. ‘What time do you want me?’</p>
<p id="blu0000325">‘Can you come at two?’</p>
<p id="blu0000326">‘I’ve a patient until two. I can get there for two thirty. Will that do?’</p>
<p id="blu0000327">‘Perfect.’</p>
<p id="blu0000328">She returned to her toast, which was cold now. She didn’t want to think about the clinic, or about Reuben. Her job was to deal with the mess and pain inside other people’s heads, but not <em>his</em> mess and not <em>his</em> pain. He was out of bounds.</p>
<p class="spacebreak" id="blu0000329">Joe Franklin was her final patient of the day. For the last sixteen months, he had been coming to see her on a Tuesday afternoon, at ten minutes past five – although sometimes he didn’t make it, or came just as his time was up. Frieda would wait without irritation, catching up with her notes or doodling on her pad of paper. She never left before all of his fifty minutes had gone by. She knew that <?pagebreak number="37"?><a id="p37"/>she was the one reliable point of his tumbling, kaleidoscopic week. Once he had told her that it was the thought of her sitting slender and straight-backed in her large red armchair that kept him going, even if he couldn’t get to her.</p>
<p id="blu0000330">Today he was thirty-five minutes late. He came staggering blindly over the threshold, like a man who had just escaped from a car crash and was still in shock; his mouth was working but no words came out. Frieda saw that his shoelaces were trailing loose, and that the buttons on his shirt were done up wrongly. She could see his stomach through it, shockingly white. His fingernails were too long and a bit dirty. His thick blond hair needed a wash. He hadn’t shaved recently. Frieda guessed he had been in bed for several days and had only now dragged himself out to get here.</p>
<p id="blu0000331">He let himself crumple into the chair facing her, the low table between them. He still hadn’t met her gaze. He stared out of the window at the line of cranes standing suspended in the thickening dusk like ghostly figures, although Frieda wondered if he was actually seeing anything out there. There was a beaten look to him. He was a lovely young man, golden and luminous, but on days like today you couldn’t see that. His face was contorted; the light had gone out of it. He looked bruised and heavy.</p>
<p id="blu0000332">Silence filled the room, not anxious but restful, and they sat inside it. This was a place of safety. Joe gave a long sigh and turned his head. His eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p id="blu0000333">‘Bad?’ asked Frieda. She pushed the box of tissues towards him.</p>
<p id="blu0000334">He nodded.</p>
<p id="blu0000335"><?pagebreak number="38"?><a id="p38"/>‘You got here. That’s something.’</p>
<p id="blu0000336">He picked a single tissue out of the box and held it softly against his face, dusting it delicately as if it was sore, then dabbed his wet eyes. He screwed up the tissue and put it on the table in a tight wet ball, then took another to repeat the process. He leaned forward and put his face in his hands. He looked up as if to speak, opened his mouth, but no words came, and when Frieda asked if there was something he wanted to say, he shook his head violently, like a beast at bay. At six o’clock, when the time came for him to leave, he hadn’t said a single word.</p>
<p id="blu0000337">Frieda stood up and opened the door for him. She watched him blunder down the stairs, his laces flapping, and then she stood at her window and saw him come out on to the street. He walked past a woman who didn’t pay him any special attention. Frieda looked at her watch. She was going out. She needed to get ready. Well, there was no hurry.</p>
<p class="spacebreak" id="blu0000338">Eight hours later Frieda swung her legs out of a bed that wasn’t hers. ‘Is there anything to drink?’ she said.</p>
<p id="blu0000339">‘There’s some beer in the fridge,’ said Sandy.</p>
<p id="blu0000340">Frieda walked into the kitchen and took a bottle from the fridge door. ‘Is there an opener?’ she called.</p>
<p id="blu0000341">‘If we went to your place, you’d know where things were,’ he said. ‘The drawer next to the stove.’</p>
<p id="blu0000342">Frieda flipped the top off the beer and walked back into the bedroom of Sandy’s small Barbican flat. She looked out of the window at the lights shimmering in the dark. Her mouth felt dry. She took a sip of the beer and swallowed. ‘If <em>I</em> lived on the fifteenth floor, I’d spend my life <?pagebreak number="39"?><a id="p39"/>looking out of the window. It’s like being on the top of a mountain.’</p>
<p id="blu0000343">She walked back to the bed. Sandy was lying wrapped in the tangled sheets. She sat on the edge and gazed down at him. He didn’t look like a Sandy; he had a more Mediterranean appearance, with olive skin and hair that was blue-black like a raven’s wing, except for a few streaks of silver. He held her stare without smiling.</p>
<p id="blu0000344">‘Oh, Frieda,’ he said.</p>
<p id="blu0000345">Frieda felt that her heart was like some old chest that had been heaved up from the seabed, its barnacled lid prised open after all this time. Who knew what treasures she would find inside? ‘Do you want some beer?’</p>
<p id="blu0000346">‘Give me some from your mouth.’</p>
<p id="blu0000347">She tipped the bottle and took a swig, then leaned over him, their lips almost touching. She felt the cool liquid trickle into his mouth. He gulped at it, coughed and laughed.</p>
<p id="blu0000348">‘It’s probably better from the bottle,’ she said.</p>
<p id="blu0000349">‘No,’ he said. ‘It’s better from your mouth.’</p>
<p id="blu0000350">They smiled at each other, and then the smiles faded. Frieda put her hand on his smooth chest. They started to say something at the same time and both apologized, then tried to speak at the same time again.</p>
<p id="blu0000351">‘You first,’ said Frieda.</p>
<p id="blu0000352">He touched the side of her face. ‘I wasn’t ready for this,’ he said. ‘It’s happened so quickly.’</p>
<p id="blu0000353">‘You make that sound like a bad thing.’</p>
<p id="blu0000354">He pulled her down on to the bed beside him and leaned over her, running a hand down her body. ‘Oh, no,’ he said. ‘But I feel I don’t know where I am.’ There was a pause. ‘Say something.’</p>
<p id="blu0000355"><?pagebreak number="40"?><a id="p40"/>‘I think I was going to say the same thing. This wasn’t part of the plan.’</p>
<p id="blu0000356">Sandy smiled. ‘You have a plan?’</p>
<p id="blu0000357">‘Not really. I spend my time helping people sort the story of their lives. Give them a narrative. But I don’t know what mine is. And now I feel I’m being carried away on something. I’m not sure what it is.’</p>
<p id="blu0000358">Sandy kissed her on the neck and the cheek, and then deeply, mouth to mouth. ‘Are you going to stay the night?’</p>
<p id="blu0000359">‘One day,’ said Frieda. ‘But not now.’</p>
<p id="blu0000360">‘And can I come to yours?’</p>
<p id="blu0000361">‘One day.’</p>
