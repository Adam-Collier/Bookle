<h1 class="chapter-title" id="blu0001839"><?pagebreak number="188"?><a id="p188"/>Chapter Twenty-three</h1>
<p class="noindent" id="blu0001840">The following afternoon, Karlsson called a press conference at which the Faradays faced a bank of photographers and journalists to make an appeal for the return of their son that would reawaken public interest.</p>
<p id="blu0001841">Karlsson had spent the morning looking through the statements his team had gathered from hundreds of so-called witnesses and the dwindling reports of possible sightings. He stood to one side. He watched the couple as the lights flashed in their faces
– faces that had undergone such a change since Matthew had disappeared. Day by day, he’d seen grief carving new lines, stretching the skin, dulling the light in their eyes. Alec Faraday’s face was still puffy and bruised from his attack, and he moved stiffly because of his broken rib. They both looked thin and strained, and her voice cracked as she talked of their darling boy, but they managed to get through it all right. They said the usual heart-breaking things. They begged the world at large to help in the search and the person in particular to give them back their beloved boy.</p>
<p id="blu0001842">It was useless, of course. These shows were largely designed to put pressure on the parents, to see if they were the guilty ones. But they all knew the Faradays couldn’t have done it. Even the papers that had accused him had done a brazen U-turn, turning him into a suffering saint instead. He’d been with a client in the accountant’s office <?pagebreak number="189"?><a id="p189"/>where he worked and had dozens of witnesses. She’d been rushing from her job as a medical receptionist to get to the school on time to collect him. And the notion that whoever it was who had grabbed Matthew would suddenly have a change of heart when he heard them speak and saw their ravaged faces was absurd, not least because the child was almost certainly dead and had been for some time. So it was left to the world to respond – and respond it would, and the deluge of misinformation and false hope that had been mercifully drying up would flood them again.</p>
<p id="blu0001843">That evening, he stayed late at work. He stared at the photos of the boy, of the place he had disappeared, at the large map in the investigation room, dotted with pins and flags. He read through statements. His brain throbbed and his chest ached.</p>
<p class="spacebreak" id="blu0001844">He stared and the other boy stared back. It was Simon. He put up a hand towards Simon, to see if he was friendly, and Simon put up his hand too, at the same time, but he didn’t smile. He was very thin and very white and his bones stuck out on his shoulders and his hips, and his willy looked like a little pink snail. When he took a step towards Simon, Simon took a step towards him. A jerky little step, like a puppet moves, and then like a puppet Simon folded to the floor and Matthew folded to the floor and they were staring at each other. Matthew put one finger to the boy’s tiny face, goblin face, hollows for cheeks and holes for eyes and a bandaged mouth, and touched the cold, speckled mirror and watched the tears stain the skin where he pressed.</p>
<p id="blu0001845">He felt hands behind him, he felt himself being held. Soft words, breath on him.</p>
<p id="blu0001846"><?pagebreak number="190"?><a id="p190"/>‘You’re going to be our little boy,’ the voice said. ‘But don’t be our bad little boy. We don’t like bad little boys.’</p>
<p class="spacebreak" id="blu0001847">When Frieda opened the door to Karlsson, he stood at the threshold as though she was expecting him, and in a way she was. She had known that this was not the end of the case of Matthew Faraday.</p>
<p id="blu0001848">‘Come in,’ she said.</p>
<p id="blu0001849">They went into the front room, where a fire was burning and a stack of academic journals lay on the arm of her chair.</p>
<p id="blu0001850">‘Am I disturbing you?’</p>
<p id="blu0001851">‘Not really. Have a seat.’ He was carrying a leather bag, slung over his shoulder. He laid it on the floor and took his coat off. He sat down. She hesitated, and then said, ‘Do you want something to drink? Coffee?’</p>
<p id="blu0001852">‘Perhaps something a bit stronger.’</p>
<p id="blu0001853">‘Wine? Whisky?’</p>
<p id="blu0001854">‘Whisky, I think. It’s that kind of night.’</p>
<p id="blu0001855">Frieda poured them both a small tumbler of whisky, adding a splash of water, then sat down opposite him. ‘How can I help?’</p>
<p id="blu0001856">Her manner was softer than usual. It almost brought tears to his eyes.</p>
<p id="blu0001857">‘It’s all I think of. I get up and I think about him and I go to bed and I dream about him. I go to the pub with the guys and we talk about stuff and I hear the words coming out of my mouth. It’s amazing how you can go around pretending everything’s normal when it’s not. I talk to my kids on the phone and ask them about their day and tell them silly, cheerful stuff about mine, and all the time I’m <?pagebreak number="191"?><a id="p191"/>just seeing him. He’s dead, you know. Or, at least, I hope he is because if he isn’t … What’s the best that can happen? That we find his body and catch the bastard who did it. That’s the best.’</p>
<p id="blu0001858">‘Is it really as hopeless as that?’</p>
<p id="blu0001859">‘In ten years’ time, in twenty, I’ll still be the copper who didn’t rescue Matthew Faraday. When I’m retired – like the old detective I visited who was in charge of the Joanna Vine case – I’ll sit in my house and think about Matthew and wonder what happened, where he’s buried, who did it and where they are now.’</p>
<p id="blu0001860">He swirled his whisky round in his tumbler, then took a gulp. ‘You probably spend half your time with people who are burdened by guilt, but in my experience, people don’t feel nearly enough guilt. They feel shame when they’re caught, all right, but no guilt if they’re not. All over the world there are people who have done terrible things and they’re living perfectly contented lives, with their families and friends.’</p>
<p id="blu0001861">He swilled back his whisky and Frieda poured more into his tumbler without asking him. She hadn’t touched hers.</p>
<p id="blu0001862">‘If I feel like this,’ he said, ‘think of the parents.’ He pulled his tie loose impatiently. ‘Am I going to be haunted all my life?’</p>
<p id="blu0001863">‘Have you never had a case like this before?’</p>
<p id="blu0001864">‘I’ve had my share of murders and suicides and domestic abuse. It’s hard to keep your faith in human nature; maybe that’s why I’m divorced and pouring my heart out to a woman I’ve met just a few times, rather than to my wife. He’s only five, the age of my youngest.’</p>
<p id="blu0001865"><?pagebreak number="192"?><a id="p192"/>‘There’s no answer to what you’re feeling,’ said Frieda. A strange mood enveloped the room where they sat, dreamy and sad.</p>
<p id="blu0001866">‘I know. I just needed to say it to someone. Sorry.’</p>
<p id="blu0001867">‘Don’t say sorry.’</p>
<p id="blu0001868">She didn’t say anything else. She looked into her glass and Karlsson looked at her, seeing a new side to her. After a while, he said, ‘Tell me about your work.’</p>
<p id="blu0001869">‘What do you want to know?’</p>
<p id="blu0001870">‘I don’t know. Are you a doctor?’</p>
<p id="blu0001871">‘Yes. Though you don’t have to be. I specialized in psychiatry before training. It’s a long process and a strict discipline. I’ve got lots of letters after my name.’</p>
<p id="blu0001872">‘OK. And are your patients mostly private? How many do you see a day? What are they like? Why are you doing it? Does it work? That kind of thing.’</p>
<p id="blu0001873">Frieda gave a small laugh, then started counting off his questions on her fingers. ‘One, I’m a mixture of private and NHS. I get referrals from the Warehouse Clinic, where I trained and worked for years, and from GPs and hospitals, and I also take people who come to me off their own bat, usually because someone they know has recommended me to them. It’s important to me not just to take on people who are rich enough to be able to afford therapy; otherwise it would be like treating the disease of the rich. Privately, therapy is quite expensive.’</p>
<p id="blu0001874">‘How much?’</p>
<p id="blu0001875">‘I have this rule of thumb. I charge two pounds for every thousand they earn – so if you earn thirty thousand you’d give me sixty pounds for each session. I had one client who told me he’d have to pay me five hundred thousand an <?pagebreak number="193"?><a id="p193"/>hour, in that case. Luckily for him, I have a cut-off point of a hundred pounds. I have been known to take people for almost nothing, though my colleagues frown on that. Anyway, I’d say that about seventy per cent of my patients are NHS referrals, maybe a bit less.</p>
<p id="blu0001876">‘OK. Number two, I usually see my patients three times a week, and I usually have seven patients – in other words, about twenty sessions a week in all. I know therapists who have eight sessions each day – that’s forty in a week. As one patient leaves, the next arrives. It makes them wealthy, but I couldn’t do that. Nor would I want to.’</p>
<p id="blu0001877">‘Why not?’</p>
<p id="blu0001878">‘I need to absorb things, think about each person I see, make proper process notes. I don’t need more money than what I get now. I need time. What was next?’</p>
<p id="blu0001879">‘What are they like?’</p>
<p id="blu0001880">‘I don’t know how to answer that. They don’t have much in common with each other.’</p>
<p id="blu0001881">‘Except they’re in a mess.’</p>
<p id="blu0001882">‘Most of us are in a mess at some time in our lives, wretched beyond bearing or dysfunctional beyond tolerating or simply stuck.’ She fixed him with her piercing glance. ‘Don’t you think?’</p>
<p id="blu0001883">‘I don’t know.’ Karlsson frowned, uncomfortable. ‘Do you ever turn people away?’</p>
<p id="blu0001884">‘If I think they don’t need therapy, or if I think they’d be better off with someone else. I only take on people I think I can help.’</p>
<p id="blu0001885">‘And what made you become a therapist?’ This was what he really wanted to know but had little expectation of her answering. They had sat companionably together and <?pagebreak number="194"?><a id="p194"/>talked, and yet he did not understand her much better or have more sense of her vulnerabilities or doubts. She kept herself to herself, he thought. The self-possession that had struck him so forcefully at their first meeting rarely wavered.</p>
<p id="blu0001886">‘That’s enough questions for one night. What about you?’</p>
<p id="blu0001887">‘What about me?’</p>
<p id="blu0001888">‘Why did you join the police force?’</p>
<p id="blu0001889">Karlsson shrugged, then stared into his whisky. ‘Fuck knows. Recently, I’ve been asking myself why I didn’t become a lawyer, the way I was meant to, earning serious money and sleeping properly at night.’</p>
<p id="blu0001890">‘What’s the answer?’</p>
<p id="blu0001891">‘There isn’t an answer. I work too hard, get paid too little, am drowning in paperwork, only get noticed when things go wrong, get pissed on by the press and by my own boss, and the public distrust me. And now that I’m heading up the Murder Investigation Team, I get to meet lots of killers and wife-beaters and perverts and drug dealers. What can I say? It just seemed like a good idea at the time.’</p>
<p id="blu0001892">‘You like it, then.’</p>
<p id="blu0001893">‘Like it? It’s what I do, and I think I do it pretty well, most of the time. Though you wouldn’t guess it from this case.’</p>
<p id="blu0001894">He seemed to remember something and reached into his bag. He took out two cardboard files. ‘These are statements made by Rosalind Teale. She’s the sister of Joanna Vine. The first statements were made just after the disappearance and then we interviewed her again the other day.’</p>
<p id="blu0001895">‘Is there something significant about them?’</p>
<p id="blu0001896">‘I know you’re resistant, but I’d like you to have a look at them.’</p>
<p id="blu0001897"><?pagebreak number="195"?><a id="p195"/>‘What for?’</p>
<p id="blu0001898">‘I’d be interested in anything you had to say.’</p>
<p id="blu0001899">‘Now?’</p>
<p id="blu0001900">‘That would be good.’</p>
<p id="blu0001901">Karlsson refilled his glass and didn’t add water. He stood up and walked around the room as if he was at a gallery. Frieda didn’t like being watched while she was reading. And she didn’t like the idea of him looking at her possessions and using them to try and learn something about her. But the quickest way to get him to stop was to read the statements. She opened the older one and began, making herself read slowly, word by word.</p>
<p id="blu0001902">‘Have you read all these books?’ Karlsson asked.</p>
<p id="blu0001903">‘Shut up,’ said Frieda, in a mumble, without even looking up from the file. As she moved on to the second, more recent, file, she was aware of Karlsson, out of her eyeline. Finally she closed it. She didn’t speak, although she knew that Karlsson was waiting.</p>
<p id="blu0001904">‘So?’ he said. ‘If she was your patient, what would you ask her?’</p>
<p id="blu0001905">‘If she was my patient, I wouldn’t ask her anything. I would try to stop her feeling guilty about her sister. Apart from that, I think she should be left alone.’</p>
<p id="blu0001906">‘She’s the only possible witness,’ said Karlsson.</p>
<p id="blu0001907">‘And she didn’t see anything. And it’s more than twenty years ago. And every time you talk to her you damage her all over again.’</p>
<p id="blu0001908">Karlsson came over and sat back down so that he was facing Frieda. He contemplated his whisky glass. ‘This is good stuff,’ he said. ‘Where did you get it?’</p>
<p id="blu0001909">‘Someone gave it to me.’</p>
<p id="blu0001910"><?pagebreak number="196"?><a id="p196"/>‘Tell me something else about the statements,’ said Karlsson. ‘You’re clever. Don’t you see this as a challenge?’</p>
<p id="blu0001911">‘Don’t think you can taunt me,’ said Frieda.</p>
<p id="blu0001912">‘I’m not taunting you. I’m at a stage where I’d be grateful for any input. I’m interested in anyone who knows about things I don’t know about.’</p>
<p id="blu0001913">Frieda paused for a moment. ‘Have you thought about the possibility that Joanna might have been taken by a woman rather than a man?’</p>
<p id="blu0001914">Karlsson put his glass down very gently on the low table by his chair. ‘Why do you say that?’</p>
<p id="blu0001915">‘The disappearance was quick,’ said Frieda. ‘Rosie Vine only lost sight of her sister for a minute or so. It doesn’t seem as if there was any fuss, any noise. This wasn’t someone being snatched on a quiet lane and thrown into the back of a van. This was a street that people walked along, with shops on it. I could imagine a little girl walking off with a woman. Taking her hand.’ Frieda imagined the scene, the little girl walking away, trustingly. Then she tried not to imagine it.</p>
<p id="blu0001916">‘That’s very interesting,’ said Karlsson.</p>
<p id="blu0001917">‘Don’t patronize me,’ said Frieda. ‘It’s not very interesting. It’s obvious and you must have considered it from the beginning.’</p>
<p id="blu0001918">‘The idea had occurred to us,’ he said. ‘It’s a possibility. You’ve got to admit, though, you’re interested.’</p>
<p id="blu0001919">‘Why are you asking me this?’ said Frieda. ‘What are you trying to get me to say?’</p>
<p id="blu0001920">‘I’d like you to talk to Rose Teale. Maybe you can get to her in a way we can’t.’</p>
<p id="blu0001921"><?pagebreak number="197"?><a id="p197"/>‘But what’s there to get at?’ She picked up the file and flicked through it.</p>
<p id="blu0001922">‘Isn’t it frustrating?’ said Karlsson. ‘When I read the statement, I have this fantasy that I could get in a time machine and be there just for a minute, just for five seconds, and then I could find out what really happened.’ He gave a sour smile.
‘That’s not the way grown-up policemen are supposed to talk.’</p>
<p id="blu0001923">Frieda looked at the statement again: the little girl talking about her younger sister. She felt she was being asked to go on a journey and after she had said yes it would be too late to turn back. Was there any point to this? Was there anything she could contribute? Well, maybe. And if she could, she must.</p>
<p id="blu0001924">‘All right,’ she said.</p>
<p id="blu0001925">‘Really?’ said Karlsson. ‘That’s great.’</p>
<p id="blu0001926">‘What I’d need,’ said Frieda, ‘are those police artists who are used for creating likenesses. Have you got that?’</p>
<p id="blu0001927">Karlsson smiled and shook his head. ‘No,’ he said. ‘We’ve got something much better.’</p>
