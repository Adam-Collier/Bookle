<p class="noindent" id="blu0000365">Detective Constable Yvette Long looked across at her boss, Detective Chief Inspector Malcolm Karlsson. ‘Are you ready for this?’ she said.</p>
<p id="blu0000366">‘Does it matter?’ he said, and they stepped outside.</p>
<p id="blu0000367">It was the side door of the court but there was no escaping the reporters and the cameras. He tried not to flinch at the lights. It would make him look shifty and defeated when it was shown on the news. He could make out some of the faces from the press gallery over the previous weeks. He heard a muddle of questions being shouted at him.</p>
<p id="blu0000368">‘One at a time,’ he said. ‘Mr Carpenter.’ This was addressed to a bald man clutching a microphone.</p>
<p id="blu0000369">‘Is the acquittal a personal humiliation or a failure of the system?’</p>
<p id="blu0000370">‘I decided on a prosecution in conjunction with the Crown Prosecution Service. That’s all I’ve got to say.’</p>
<p id="blu0000371">A woman put up her hand. She was from one of the quality papers. He couldn’t remember which.</p>
<p id="blu0000372">‘You’ve been accused of bringing the case prematurely. What’s your response?’</p>
<p id="blu0000373">‘I was in charge of the inquiry. I take full responsibility.’</p>
<p id="blu0000374">‘Are you restarting your inquiry?’</p>
<p id="blu0000375">‘Investigating officers will consider any new evidence.’</p>
<p id="blu0000376">‘Do you think this operation was a waste of manpower and public money?’</p>
<p id="blu0000377"><?pagebreak number="42"?><a id="p42"/>‘I thought we assembled a compelling case,’ said Karlsson, trying to suppress a feeling of nausea. ‘The jury apparently disagreed.’</p>
<p id="blu0000378">‘Will you resign?’</p>
<p id="blu0000379">‘No.’</p>
<p class="spacebreak" id="blu0000380">Later that day there was, following tradition, a wake at the Duke of Westminster pub. A group of officers formed a noisy huddle in the corner, under a display of nautical knots in a glass case. DC Long sat down next to Karlsson. She was holding two glasses of whisky, then saw that he had barely touched the one he already had.</p>
<p id="blu0000381">Karlsson looked across at the other officers. ‘They’re in quite a good mood,’ he said. ‘Considering.’</p>
<p id="blu0000382">‘Because you took all the blame,’ she said. ‘Which you shouldn’t have done.’</p>
<p id="blu0000383">‘That’s my job,’ he said.</p>
<p id="blu0000384">Yvette Long looked around and gave a start. ‘I can’t believe it,’ she said. ‘Crawford’s here. The cunt that dropped you in it. He’s actually here.’</p>
<p id="blu0000385">Karlsson smiled. He’d never heard her swear before. She must be really angry. The commissioner hovered at the bar, then came over and sat with them. He didn’t notice DC Long glaring at him. He slid a glass of whisky across to Karlsson. ‘Add that to your collection,’ he said. ‘You deserve it.’</p>
<p id="blu0000386">‘Thank you, sir,’ said Karlsson.</p>
<p id="blu0000387">‘You took one for the team today,’ Crawford said. ‘Don’t think I didn’t notice. I know I pushed you. There were political reasons. We needed to be seen to be doing something.’</p>
<p id="blu0000388"><?pagebreak number="43"?><a id="p43"/>Karlsson pushed his glasses together, as if he were considering which one to drink from first. ‘It was my decision,’ he said.
‘I was in charge.’</p>
<p id="blu0000389">‘You’re not talking to the press now, Mal,’ said Crawford. ‘Cheers.’ He drained his glass and stood up. ‘Can’t stop,’ he said.
‘There’s a dinner with the home secretary. You know the sort of thing. I’ll just wander over and commiserate with the lads.’ Then he leaned closer to Karlsson, as if he was confiding something personal. ‘Still,’ he said. ‘You’re due a result. Better luck next time.’</p>
<p class="spacebreak" id="blu0000390">Reuben McGill still smoked like it was the 1980s. Or the 1950s. He took a Gitanes from his packet, lit it and snapped his lighter shut. At first he didn’t speak and Frieda didn’t either. She sat opposite his desk and scrutinized him. In a way he looked better than he had when she had first met him, fifteen years earlier. His full head of hair was now grey, his face was more wrinkled, even jowly, but that just added to his vagrant charm. He still wore jeans and an open-necked shirt. This was a man who was telling you – telling his patients – that he wasn’t part of the system.</p>
<p id="blu0000391">‘Good to see you,’ he said.</p>
<p id="blu0000392">‘Paz rang me.’</p>
<p id="blu0000393">‘Did she now? It’s like being surrounded by spies. Are you a spy as well? So, what do you think? Now that you’ve been summoned.’</p>
<p id="blu0000394">‘I’m on the board of the clinic,’ said Frieda. ‘It means that if someone expresses a concern, I need to respond.’</p>
<p id="blu0000395">‘So respond,’ said Reuben. ‘What should I do? Tidy my desk?’</p>
<p id="blu0000396">The surface of the desk was hidden under piles of <?pagebreak number="44"?><a id="p44"/>books and papers and files and journals. There were pens and mugs and plates.</p>
<p id="blu0000397">‘It’s not the mess,’ said Frieda. ‘What I can’t help noticing is that it’s the same mess as when I came in here three weeks ago. I’m not clear why you haven’t introduced new mess. Why it hasn’t changed.’</p>
<p id="blu0000398">He laughed. ‘You’re dangerous, Frieda. I should only agree to meet you on neutral territory. As you’ve probably heard, Paz and the rest of them don’t think that I’ve ticked enough boxes, dotted enough <em>i</em>s. I’m sorry, I’m too busy caring for people.’</p>
<p id="blu0000399">‘Paz is looking out for you,’ said Frieda. ‘So am I. You talk about ticking boxes. Maybe it’s a warning sign. And maybe it’s better to hear from the people who love you before the people who don’t love you start to notice. Allegedly there are such people.’</p>
<p id="blu0000400">‘Allegedly,’ said Reuben. ‘You know what you’d do if you really wanted to help me?’</p>
<p id="blu0000401">‘What?’</p>
<p id="blu0000402">‘You’d come and work here full-time.’</p>
<p id="blu0000403">‘I’m not sure that would be a good idea.’</p>
<p id="blu0000404">‘Why not? You could still have your own patients. And you could keep an eye on me.’</p>
<p id="blu0000405">‘I don’t want to keep an eye on you, Reuben. I’m not responsible for you and you’re not responsible for me. I like to have autonomy.’</p>
<p id="blu0000406">‘What did I do wrong?’</p>
<p id="blu0000407">‘How do you mean?’</p>
<p id="blu0000408">‘Almost from the moment you came here as an eager young student, I saw you as the person who’d take this over from me some day. What happened?’</p>
<p id="blu0000409"><?pagebreak number="45"?><a id="p45"/>Frieda gave a frown of disbelief. ‘One, you were never going to hand your baby over to anyone. And two, I don’t want to run anything. I don’t want to spend my life checking that the phone bill’s been paid and that the fire doors are kept closed.’ Frieda paused. ‘When I first came here, I knew that it was – just at that moment – the best place in the world for me. It’s hard to keep something like that up. I couldn’t.’</p>
<p id="blu0000410">‘You think I haven’t? Is that what you’re saying – that it’s gone downhill?’</p>
<p id="blu0000411">‘It’s like a restaurant,’ said Frieda. ‘You cook a great meal one night. But you’ve got to do it the next night and the next. Most people can’t manage that.’</p>
<p id="blu0000412">‘I’m not making fucking pizza. I’m helping people cope with their lives. What am I doing wrong? Tell me.’</p>
<p id="blu0000413">‘I didn’t say you were doing anything wrong.’</p>
<p id="blu0000414">‘Except you have concerns about me.’</p>
<p id="blu0000415">‘Perhaps,’ said Frieda, carefully, ‘you should delegate a bit more.’</p>
<p id="blu0000416">‘Is that what people think?’</p>
<p id="blu0000417">‘The Warehouse is your creation, Reuben. It’s been an extraordinary achievement. It’s helped people. But you can’t be too possessive of it. If you are, it will collapse as soon as you leave. Surely you don’t want that. It’s not the same place as it was when you started it in your back room.’</p>
<p id="blu0000418">‘Of course it’s not.’</p>
<p id="blu0000419">‘Have you ever thought that your present lack of grip on things here is a way of letting go, without having to admit that’s what you’re doing?’</p>
<p id="blu0000420">‘Lack of grip? Because my desk is in a mess?’</p>
<p id="blu0000421">‘And that perhaps it would be better to do it more rationally?’</p>
<p id="blu0000422"><?pagebreak number="46"?><a id="p46"/>‘Fuck off. I’m not in the mood for therapy.’</p>
<p id="blu0000423">‘I was going anyway.’ Frieda stood up. ‘I’ve got a meeting.’</p>
<p id="blu0000424">‘So, am I on some kind of probation?’ said Reuben.</p>
<p id="blu0000425">‘What’s the problem with crossing
<em>t</em> s? If you don’t cross them, you can’t tell that they’re <em>t</em> s.’</p>
<p id="blu0000426">‘Who’s your meeting with? Is it to do with me?’</p>
<p id="blu0000427">‘I’m seeing my trainee. It’s our regular session and we won’t be talking about you.’</p>
<p id="blu0000428">Reuben stubbed his cigarette out in what was already an overflowing ashtray. ‘You can’t just hide away in your little room talking to people for the rest of your life,’ he said. ‘You’ve got to get out in the world and get your hands dirty.’</p>
<p id="blu0000429">‘I thought that talking to people in a little room was our job.’</p>
<p class="spacebreak" id="blu0000430">When Frieda came out of Reuben’s office she found Jack Dargan hovering in the corridor. He was a gangly young man – ardent, clever and impatient – and he was on attachment to the clinic, just as Frieda had been when she was his age. He sat in on group-therapy sessions, and he had a patient. Each week Frieda met him to discuss their progress. On the first day they had met, aware that it was a cliché, knowing that she was aware of it and despising himself, Jack had fallen head over heels in love with her.</p>
<p id="blu0000431">‘I need to get out of here,’ she said. ‘Come on.’</p>
<p id="blu0000432">They passed a man coming towards them, a lost expression on his round face, his spaniel eyes baffled.</p>
<p id="blu0000433">‘Can I help you?’ she asked.</p>
<p id="blu0000434">‘I’m looking for Dr McGill.’</p>
<p id="blu0000435">‘In there.’ She nodded towards the closed door.</p>
<p id="blu0000436"><?pagebreak number="47"?><a id="p47"/>As she walked out of the clinic, past Paz, who was talking on the phone garrulously and throwing her ringed hands around in extravagant gestures, she felt suddenly like a mother duck with a solitary duckling walking after her. There was a bus coming up the hill as they came out on to the road and she and Jack climbed aboard. He was flustered. He didn’t know whether to sit on the seat beside her or to take the one in front or behind. When he did take the one next to her, he sat on her skirt and leaped up again as if scalded.</p>
<p id="blu0000437">‘Where are we going?’</p>
<p id="blu0000438">‘There’s a café some people I know run. It’s their new venture and near where I live. It’s open through the day.’</p>
<p id="blu0000439">‘Fine,’ said Jack. ‘Great. Yes.’ And ground to a halt.</p>
<p id="blu0000440">Frieda stared out of the window, saying nothing, and Jack looked surreptitiously at her. He’d never been quite this close to her. His thigh touched hers and he could smell her perfume. When the bus swung round a corner, his whole body pressed against hers. He knew nothing about her life. She had no ring on her left hand so presumably she wasn’t married. But did she live with someone? Did she have a lover? Maybe she was gay – he couldn’t tell. What did she do when she left the clinic? What did she wear when she wasn’t wearing her mannish suits, her plain skirts? Did she ever let her hair down, dance, drink too much?</p>
<p id="blu0000441">When they got off the bus, Jack had to walk swiftly to keep up with Frieda as she led him through a maze of streets, into Beech Street. It was full of one-room restaurants and cluttered cafés, little art galleries, shops selling cheese, ceramic tiles, stationery. There was a one-day dry-cleaner’s, a hardware shop, a twenty-four-hour <?pagebreak number="48"?><a id="p48"/>supermarket with newspapers in Polish and Greek as well as English.</p>
<p id="blu0000442">Number 9 was warm inside, and plainly decorated. It smelt of baking bread and coffee. There were only half a dozen wooden tables, most of them empty, and some stools at the bar.</p>
<p id="blu0000443">The woman behind the counter raised her hand in greeting. ‘How are you since this morning?’</p>
<p id="blu0000444">‘Good,’ said Frieda. ‘Kerry, this is my colleague, Jack. Jack, this is Kerry Headley.’</p>
<p id="blu0000445">Jack, pink with gratification at being called Frieda’s colleague, muttered something.</p>
<p id="blu0000446">Kerry beamed at him. ‘What can I get you? There aren’t many cakes left – Marcus is going to make some more soon. He’s collecting Katya from school at the moment. There are a few flapjacks left.’</p>
<p id="blu0000447">‘Just coffee,’ said Frieda. ‘From your shiny new machine, thanks. Jack?’</p>
<p id="blu0000448">‘Same,’ said Jack, although he was already twitchy with caffeine and nerves.</p>
<p id="blu0000449">They sat at a table by the window, facing each other. Jack took off his bulky coat and Frieda saw that he was wearing brown corduroy trousers and a vividly striped open-necked shirt with a lime green T-shirt visible underneath. His trainers were grubby and his tawny hair was wild, as if he’d spent the day pushing his fingers into it in exasperation.</p>
<p id="blu0000450">‘Is that what you wear when you see your patient?’ said Frieda.</p>
<p id="blu0000451">‘It’s not the exact clothes. This is just what I wear. Is that a problem?’</p>
<p id="blu0000452"><?pagebreak number="49"?><a id="p49"/>‘I think you should wear something more neutral.’</p>
<p id="blu0000453">‘Like a suit and tie?’</p>
<p id="blu0000454">‘No, not like a suit and tie. Something boring, like a plain shirt or a jacket. Something more invisible. You don’t want the patient to get too interested in you.’</p>
<p id="blu0000455">‘There’s not much chance of that.’</p>
<p id="blu0000456">‘What do you mean?’</p>
<p id="blu0000457">‘This guy I’m meant to be giving therapy to is just completely self-absorbed. That’s what his real problem is. I mean, that’s bad, isn’t it? If I’m starting to find my very first patient a complete pain in the arse.’</p>
<p id="blu0000458">‘You don’t need to like him. You just need to help him.’</p>
<p id="blu0000459">‘This guy,’ Jack continued, ‘is having problems with his marriage. But it turns out that the problems have arisen because there’s a woman in his office he wants to sleep with. He’s basically gone into therapy because he wants me to agree with him that his wife doesn’t understand him and that it’s OK for him to go and explore other possibilities. It’s like he’s got to go through the hoops so that he can give himself permission and feel good about it.’</p>
<p id="blu0000460">‘And?’</p>
<p id="blu0000461">‘When I was at medical school I thought I was being trained to cure people. In their bodies, in their minds. I’m not very happy if my job as a therapist is just to make him feel all right about cheating on his wife.’</p>
<p id="blu0000462">‘Is that what you think you’re doing?’ Frieda looked at him attentively, noting his mixture of nervousness and impassioned eagerness. He had eczema on his wrists and his nails were bitten. He wanted to please her and he wanted to challenge her. He spoke quickly, in a rush of words, and the colour came and went on his cheeks.</p>
<p id="blu0000463"><?pagebreak number="50"?><a id="p50"/>‘I don’t know what I’m doing,’ said Jack. ‘That’s what I’m saying. This is where I can be honest, right? I don’t feel comfortable encouraging him to be unfaithful. On the other hand, I can’t just say, “Thou shalt not commit adultery.” That’s not therapy.’</p>
<p id="blu0000464">‘Why shouldn’t he commit adultery?’ said Frieda. ‘You don’t know what his wife is like. She could be forcing him into it. She could be committing adultery herself.’</p>
<p id="blu0000465">‘All I know about her is what he tells me. You say people need to find a narrative for their lives. He seems to have found one and it’s bloody convenient for him. I’m trying to have empathy for him, though he makes that difficult, but he’s not trying to have empathy for his wife. Or anyone. I’m troubled by this. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to just collude with him in being a sleazebag. What would you do?’</p>
<p id="blu0000466">And he sat back and picked up his coffee, spilling some of it as he lifted it to his mouth. Behind him, a stocky man came through the door, towing a child, whose large school backpack made her look like a tortoise. The man nodded at Frieda and raised his hand in greeting.</p>
<p id="blu0000467">‘You can’t give therapy to the world,’ said Frieda. ‘And you can’t go out and change it to suit yourself. All you can do is deal with that little bit of the world that’s in your patient’s head. You don’t want to give him permission, that’s not your job. But you want him to be honest with himself. When I talk about a narrative, I didn’t mean that any narrative would do. You could start by trying to get him to understand why he wants your approval for this. Why doesn’t he just go and do it?’</p>
<p id="blu0000468">‘If I put it like that, maybe he will just go and do it.’</p>
<p id="blu0000469"><?pagebreak number="51"?><a id="p51"/>‘At least he’ll be taking responsibility for it, instead of shuffling it off on you.’ Frieda paused and thought for a moment.
‘Are you getting on with Dr McGill in those group-therapy sessions?’</p>
<p id="blu0000470">Jack looked wary. ‘I don’t think he has much time for me. Or any of us, actually. I’d heard so much about him before I got a placement at the Warehouse, but he seems a bit stressed and distracted. I don’t think we’re his priority. You’re the one who knows him, aren’t you?’</p>
<p id="blu0000471">‘Maybe.’</p>
