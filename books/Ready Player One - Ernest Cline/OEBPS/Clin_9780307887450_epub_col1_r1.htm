<h1 class="otherbooks" id="col1">More Advance Praise<br/>for <em>Ready Player One</em></h1>
<div class="block">
<p class="nonindent"><strong>“[An] adrenaline shot of uncut geekdom</strong> … sweet, self-deprecating Wade, whose universe is an odd mix of the real past and the virtual present, is <strong>the perfect lovable/unlikely hero.”</strong></p>
<p class="attribution"><strong><em>—Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="nonindent"><strong>“The pure, unfettered brainscream of a child of the ’80s</strong>, like a dream my thirteen-year-old self would have had after bingeing on Pop Rocks and Coke.… <strong>I couldn’t put it down.”</strong></p>
<p class="attribution"><strong>—Charles Ardai, Edgar Award–winning author</strong><br/><strong>and producer of</strong> <strong><em>Haven</em></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="nonindent"><strong>“Pure geek heaven</strong>. Ernest Cline’s hero competes in a virtual world with life-and-death stakes—which is only fitting, because he’s fighting to make his dreams into reality. Cline blends a dystopic future with meticulously detailed nostalgia to create <strong>a story that will resonate in the heart of every true nerd.”</strong></p>
<p class="attribution"><strong>—Christopher Farnsworth, author of</strong> <strong><em>Blood Oath</em></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="nonindent"><strong>“A fantastic adventure set in a futuristic world with a retro heart</strong>. Once I started reading, I didn’t want to put it down and I couldn’t wait to pick it back up.”</p>
<p class="attribution"><strong>—S. G. Browne, author of</strong> <strong><em>Breathers</em></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="nonindent">“Cline has somehow managed to jack into the nervous system of some great warm collective geek-dream nostalgia of the ’70s and ’80s and used the precious touchstones he’s rediscovered there to create <strong>an adventure</strong> <strong>that’s almost more experienced than read.…</strong> <strong><em>Ready Player One</em></strong> <strong>let me</strong> <strong>romp through some of the best memories of my youth.”</strong></p>
<p class="attribution"><strong>—Paul Malmont, author of</strong> <strong><em>The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril</em></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="nonindent"><strong>“Imagine that Dungeons and Dragons and an ’80s video arcade made hot, sweet love, and their child was raised in Azeroth</strong>. If you’re not already experiencing a nerdgasm at the thought, I don’t want to know you.”</p>
<p class="attribution"><strong>—John Scalzi</strong>, <strong><em>New York Times</em></strong> <strong>bestselling author of</strong> <strong><em>Old Man’s War</em></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="nonindent">“<em>Ready Player One</em> expertly mines a copious vein of 1980s pop culture, catapulting the reader on a light-speed adventure in an advanced but backward-looking future. <strong>If this book were a living room, it would be wood-paneled. If it were shoes, it would be high-tops. And if it were a song, well, it would have to be ‘Eye of the Tiger.’ I really, really loved it.”</strong></p>
<p class="attribution"><strong>—Daniel H. Wilson, author of</strong> <strong><em>Robopocalypse</em></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="nonindent">“I was blown away by this book.… <strong>Ernie Cline has pulled the raddest of all magic tricks: He’s managed to write a novel that’s at once serious and playful, that is as fun to read as it is harrowing</strong>. A book of ideas, a potboiler, a game-within-a-novel, a serious science-fiction epic, a comic pop-culture mash-up—call this novel what you will, but <em>Ready Player One</em> will defy every label you try to put on it. <strong>Here, finally, is this generation’s</strong> <strong><em>Neuromancer.</em>”</strong></p>
<p class="attribution"><strong>—Will Lavender</strong>, <strong><em>New York Times</em></strong> <strong>bestselling author of</strong> <strong><em>Obedience</em></strong></p>
