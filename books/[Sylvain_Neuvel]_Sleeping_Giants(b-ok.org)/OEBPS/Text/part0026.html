<p class="para-wl1s">—It is an interesting accent you have, Ms. Papantoniou. Is that from the Balkans?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—Yes, most of Greece is in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—You must be from a region I have not visited. It is very unique.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—Thank you. I’m curious to know why we’re meeting at the p…public library. I’m sorry. I get nervous when I t…talk to people.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—There is no need to apologize. I did not want us to be disturbed. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—The pleasure is mine. What did you want to di…discuss?</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—It has come to my attention that you disapprove of the direction this project is taking. I would be remiss if I did not take such complaint seriously, especially coming from someone of your intelligence.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—Thank you very much. I didn’t mean to go over your h…head.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—So it was an accident?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I…</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—It does not matter. Now, tell me, what is it that you find so objectionable in the way that Dr. Franklin is leading her team?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I have all the respect in the world for Dr. Franklin. She is a very good physicist.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—But?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—But she does make mistakes. She’s not as…she’s not as brilliant as you think she is. I often find it necessary to d…double-check her calculations.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—I am certain she appreciates.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—More than anything, Dr. Franklin is too…fragile. She lets her feelings for the members of her team cloud her judgment. She treats Kara and Vincent as if they were her ch…children. Kara is a stubborn, unyielding person, and I feel it is…irresponsible to rely entirely on her good will for this project to move f…forward. I have requested, on several occasions, that she submit to a series of tests to determine why the helmet will only activate for her, and Dr. Franklin has systematically refused.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Is that statement really accurate? I was told that Ms. Resnik submitted a saliva sample and that you performed an analysis of that sample. In fact, I remember seeing a report in which you conclude that there is nothing out of the ordinary about her genetics.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I did perform some genetic and biochemical tests and found no chromosomal anomalies, nor any obvious mutation. But there are a lot more tests, mitochondrial analysis. I haven’t even done a full genome sequencing. I could study her brain structure, her eyes might also be the answer.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Dr. Franklin also performed a retina scan if I am not mistaken.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I meant that I could study a sample of her eye, not a picture of it.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Could these other procedures wait until we have recovered all the pieces from the robot, and solved our more immediate problems?</p>
<p class="para-pf-alt">—You don’t understand. It’s not just Kara. We can’t…we can’t move forward without Vincent now. What if he doesn’t survive? What if he can’t w…walk again? Understanding why the helmet worked for Kara might be the key to replacing Vincent as well.</p>
<p class="para-wll">With all due respect, there is too much at stake here to worry about personal feelings, or some mild dis…comfort while I insert a needle into someone’s eye. I thought you of all people…</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—You thought I of all people?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I thought you were…pragmatic, that you understood what needed to be done. Maybe you’ve also become emotionally attached.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Are you questioning my judgment?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—Let me ask you this. If we needed dogs, and not humans, to control this machine, would we not already have a dozen pu…puppies to spare?</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Puppies…I find the question is a lot more interesting than any answer I could provide. But I thank you for shedding new light on the situation. I have found your comments both insightful and interesting and, I promise you, I will take everything you said under advisement.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—Thank you. That’s all I ask.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Good day, Ms. Papantoniou.</p>
