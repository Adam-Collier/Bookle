<blockquote class="calibre5">
<p class="para-wl1s">—How are you feeling physically? Do you require medical attention?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I’m OK. Thank you.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Is there anything I can get you to make you more comfortable? You were exposed to the cold for quite some time.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I’m fine, really. They let me take a shower and gave me some warm clothes. Thank you.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Do you know who I am?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—No, I’m sorry. I don’t know anyone in Ireland.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—What are you doing in this country?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I’ve been kidnapped! Look, I’ve told you people a dozen times already. I don’t know how I ended up in Europe. A truck driver found me on the side of the road this morning—naked, for God’s sake.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—You say you have been kidnapped. Can you tell me how it happened?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I was driving home from work when this van hit the brakes right in front of me. I crashed into it pretty hard. Someone dragged me out of my car. I must have fainted afterward.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Where is home?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I’m an American. I live in Chicago.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—You fainted and you woke up on the side of the road near Dublin.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—Yes…I…Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—What is it?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I’m not sure. I think I was awake for a few seconds in between. I couldn’t see anything, but I heard some voices.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—How many voices did you hear?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—Four or five. I don’t know. I’m not even sure I didn’t dream the whole thing.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—What were they saying?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I couldn’t tell. I don’t know what language they were speaking. It sounded like…I don’t know what it sounded like. Maybe Swedish, Lakota with a heavy German accent. I really don’t know. Something I’ve never heard before.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—How do you know what Lakota sounds like?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I don’t really. <em class="char-i">Dances with Wolves?</em> It’s the only Native American language I can think of. I was born in South Dakota. There are a few reservations around. Actually, the whole area where we lived used to be Lakota territory.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—You have no papers, no identification of any kind. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I told you. I was completely naked when I woke up. I don’t know what happened to my bag.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—You should know that the doctors who examined you found no signs of sexual activity.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—Thank you. That’s a relief.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Can you think of anything that would help us confirm your identity?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—No, not in Ireland. That’s not a crime, is it? If you get me home, you can talk to my friends, people I work with.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—I would like to show you some photos.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—Go ahead.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Do you recognize the woman in this picture?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—No, I don’t know who that is. She’s pretty.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—How about this man?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I don’t know him either. Who is he?</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—A linguist from Canada.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—A lin…Do you think these are the people who abducted me?</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—I do not. In fact, I can tell you without hesitation that they are not.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—Then why show me their pictures?</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—To see whether or not you recognized them.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—Is there a reason I should? I can tell you I don’t have amnesia. Aside from the few hours I was unconscious, I remember everything very clearly.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Can I ask you one more personal question? How old are you?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I’m twenty-seven.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—For the record, could you please state your name and occupation one more time?</p>
<p class="para-wls">—My name is Rose Franklin. I’m a researcher at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Your DNA profile is indeed a match to that of Dr. Franklin.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—You seem surprised. I know who I am. Can I please go home now? I haven’t fed my cat since I left for work yesterday.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—…Ms. Franklin, from what I understand, that was more than four years ago.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—Wh…That makes no sense. I was kidnapped. I wasn’t in a coma. It’s not like I slept for four years.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—I believe you. Strange as it may seem, there is no accurate scientific method for determining the age of a living person. However, the results of your physical examination and dental X-rays are consistent with your being twenty-seven.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I know, I told you my age.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—What I meant is that you are missing recent scars and some dental work that was done to Dr. Franklin after the age of twenty-seven.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—I…I don’t understand.</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Dr. Rose Franklin would be thirty-one years old by now.</p>
<p class="para-wls">—What exactly do you mean by “would be”?</p>
<p class="para-wl1s">—Please come with me, there is much we need to discuss…</p>
