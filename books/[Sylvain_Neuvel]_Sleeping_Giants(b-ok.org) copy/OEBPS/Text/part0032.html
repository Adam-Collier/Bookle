<p class="para-cda">PRELIMINARY REPORT—DISAPPEARANCE OF FLIGHT ICELANDAIR 670</p>
<p class="para-cda1">FAA Office of Accident Investigation and&#160;Prevention</p>
<p class="para-pf-alt">Flight Icelandair 670 (FI670), scheduled for a nonstop flight from Denver International Airport (DEN) to Keflavik, Reykjavik (KEF), disappeared from Air Traffic Control instruments at approximately 10:31 on the morning of August 10. The Boeing 757-200 called ready for taxi from Gate A-43 of Denver International Airport at 10:16. Following instructions from Denver Ground, the plane taxied to Runway 17L through taxiways M and ED, holding short of the runway before contacting the tower. Flight 670 was cleared for takeoff immediately after assuming position on the runway. The entire communication between the tower and FI670 is reproduced below. Prior communication with ATC shows nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<div class="calibre2">
<p class="para-diaf"><strong class="char-b">FI670:</strong> Tower, this is ICEAIR 670 holding on Echo Delta for Runway 17 Left.</p>
<p class="para-dia"><strong class="char-b">ATC:</strong> Good morning ICEAIR 670. She’s all yours, into position on Runway 17 Left.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page169" title="169" class="calibre3"></span>
<p class="para-dia"><strong class="char-b">FI670:</strong> Roger that.</p>
<div class="fixed-box-center">
<p class="para-dia-alt">In position, 670.</p>
</div>
<p class="para-dia"><strong class="char-b">ATC:</strong> ICEAIR 670, you are clear to takeoff, Runway 17 Left, contact departure 1-2-6-1 in the air.</p>
<div class="fixed-box-center">
<p class="para-dia-alt">670, you’re clear to go…</p>
<p class="para-dia-alt">ICEAIR 670, I lost you on my screen. Can you read back?</p>
</div>
<p class="para-dia"><strong class="char-b">FI670:</strong> Where the hell is that light coming from?</p>
<p class="para-dia"><strong class="char-b">ATC:</strong> Can you repeat that 670?</p>
<div class="fixed-box-center">
<p class="para-dia-alt">ICEAIR 670, this is the tower, please respond.</p>
<p class="para-wls">670, please respond…</p>
</div>

<p class="para-p">Investigators were on-site around 12:15 <span class="smallcaps">P</span>.<span class="smallcaps">M</span>. and FAA personnel were denied access to the site. However, the abundant news footage of the incident showed that only the southernmost section (estimate: two hundred feet) of Runway 17L/35R remained intact. A large crater, approximately fifteen hundred feet across, three hundred feet deep, covered the remaining part of the runway and the surrounding taxiways. The examined footage shows no sign of wreckage, no debris of any kind.</p>
<p class="para-p">The complete absence of evidence, coupled with the extraordinary nature of the circumstances, strongly suggests that neither mechanical failure nor pilot error are responsible for the disappearance of flight 670 and that the aircraft could not be responsible for the destruction of Runway 17L/35R. The circumstances of the incident, while currently unexplained, clearly fall beyond the expertise of the FAA and no further investigation is warranted at this point.</p>
