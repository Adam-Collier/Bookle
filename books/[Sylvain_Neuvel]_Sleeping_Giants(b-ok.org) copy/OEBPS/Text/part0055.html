<h2 class="para-bmst">(IN REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER)</h2>
<p class="para-pf-alt">A giant-robot-sized thank-you to my editor, Mark Tavani and everyone at Del Rey. Thank you, Mark, for giving this book a home, for your enthusiasm and guidance, and for coping with my semicolon addiction. Thank you, Seth Fishman, my winged agent; and Rebecca Gardner and Will Roberts at The Gernert Co. Seth, you rule. Thank you for putting me out of business as a publisher.</p>
<p class="para-p">I wouldn’t be writing any of this without my movie agent, Jon Cassir at CAA (I also couldn’t say things like “my movie agent”). Thank you Jon. That brings me to Josh Bratman. Josh, you know what you did. Thank you for changing my life.</p>
<p class="para-p">Many thanks to my beta readers, especially to Toby and Andrew. You guys are definitely alphas. Thank you, Barbara, for letting me ignore you for a few hours every night, though I strongly suspect you were just happy to have more time to read.</p>
<p class="para-p">Thank you, Theodore. You asked so many questions when I offered to make you a toy robot, I had to write a book about it. Thank you, Jean, for passing your love of language on to me. Thank you, Thérèse, for giving me the guts to try just about anything.</p>
