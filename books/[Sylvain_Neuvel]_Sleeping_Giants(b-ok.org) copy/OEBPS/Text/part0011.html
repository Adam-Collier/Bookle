<p class="para-pf-alt">More than half a city block was destroyed last night in Flagstaff, in what authorities are calling a terrorist plot gone wrong.</p>
<p class="para-p">Suspected domestic terrorist Owen Lehman died last night around 1:00 <span class="smallcaps">A</span>.<span class="smallcaps">M</span>., along with his 15-year-old son and 6 other people, in what appears to be a tragic bomb-making accident.</p>
<p class="para-p">Lehman, who had been denied disability benefits back in 2012, had been sending increasingly hostile letters to the Federal government. “The language used in some of his recent correspondence was considered threatening. We took it seriously,” said FBI Agent Robert Armstrong from the Phoenix field office. “Trace elements, as well as fragments recovered on-site, lead us to believe Mr. Lehman was attempting to build a large explosive device, which must have accidently detonated.” The FBI had been monitoring Mr. Lehman for several months but lacked sufficient evidence for an arrest. “Obviously, we wish we knew then what we know now,” said Armstrong, “but we believe the intended target was the Social Security office on Woodlands Village Blvd.”</p>
<p class="para-p">When asked about the absence of any fire damage, Armstrong added: “The explosion ruptured waterworks directly below Mr. Lehman’s residence. That created some sort of landslide, which swallowed most of the debris and put out the fire. We got lucky. It could have been a lot worse.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Nearby resident Clarissa Parlow said Lehman was well liked by his neighbors. “He had a quiet way about him. He seemed shy, more than anything. I guess you just never know about people.”</p>
<p class="para-p">Further investigation is under way. Governor Udell plans to address the media later today when he visits the site.</p>
