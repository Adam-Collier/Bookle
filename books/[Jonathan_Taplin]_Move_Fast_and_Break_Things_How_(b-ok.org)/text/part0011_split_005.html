<p class="noindent">The Harvard Business School guru Clayton Christensen (<em class="calibre2">The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail</em>) argues, “Financial markets—and <a id="page-123"></a>companies themselves—use assessment metrics that make innovations that eliminate jobs more attractive than those that create jobs.” Whereas the return on “efficiency innovations” is relatively quick, the more important “market-creating innovations,” which create entirely new industries that produce jobs, have a long time in which to return the investment. Even Silicon Valley heroes such as Elon Musk and his Tesla car are merely producing what Christensen calls “performance-improving innovations [that] replace old products with new and better models. They generally create few jobs because they’re substitutive: When customers buy the new product, they usually don’t buy the old product.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">While economists of such different political affiliations as Paul Krugman, Larry Summers, and Tyler Cowen all have written extensively about the cause of the joblessness and “secular stagnation” in the US economy that has endured since 2000, they never examine the role that monopoly capitalism might play in this crisis. If the rise of monopoly can be seen as a cause of economic stagnation, why has it endured? Because, as Peter Thiel points out in his book, “whereas a competitive firm must sell at a market price, a monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices. Since it has no competition, it produces at the quantity and price combination that maximizes its profits.” The Bork rule, which looks only at consumer prices, allows these digital monopolies to prosper, and it is only under such a rule that a company like Google, with an 85 percent market share in its core business, would not be subject to prosecution. It is only under the Bork rule that Amazon, with <a id="page-124"></a>70 percent of the ebook business, would escape judgment. And of course the Bork rule makes no provision for monopsonies like Amazon. The effect of Amazon’s monopsony in the book business is to constantly force authors and publishers to work for less money. In Bork’s view, as long as the customer gets lower prices, society should not care that writers cannot make a living, that independent bookstores go out of business, and that publishers die.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It may well be that Alexander Hamilton’s vision of an American government controlled by the financial elites has been the norm—with the exception of the two Roosevelt presidencies. FDR grasped how much of an outlier he was when he wrote to Edward M. House, President Wilson’s close adviser, “The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.” But it would take Google to really perfect that model.</p>
