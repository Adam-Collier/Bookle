<p class="noindent">The curly-haired Harvard sophomore Mark Zuckerberg, who in the fall of 2003 wrote the program for a site called Facemash, would hardly have been picked out as a future <em class="calibre2">Time</em> magazine Person of the Year. With green eyes in a sea of freckles, his head seems a bit big for his slender frame. Most of his life he has dressed in a uniform of gray T-shirt, baggy jeans, and Adidas flip-flops. He conceived Facemash in a fit of pique over a girl who had put him down and programmed the website to compare Harvard students for “hotness.” Using code that had been designed to compare computer chess players, Facemash would show you two faces of the same sex and allow you to rate which was hotter. Then the one you picked would be matched with a new opponent. In the first iteration of the program, an occasional farm animal would appear. In classic “don’t ask permission” form, Zuckerberg ripped all the photos off hacked online “facebooks” maintained by each of the Harvard residential houses (dorms). These were classic bad driver’s license–style pictures taken at orientation. After deleting the farm animals, Zuckerberg launched the site, running it off his laptop from his dorm room over the Harvard network.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the first several hours the site was up, it was visited by 450 students who had voted on twenty-two thousand pairs of photographs. The computer services department couldn’t figure out why the school’s network was slowing down until they traced it to Zuckerberg’s dorm room, at which point they shut off his Web access. The next <a id="page-147"></a>morning, after complaints of sexism, racism, and general stupidity, Zuckerberg was on the cover of the <em class="calibre2">Harvard Crimson</em> newspaper and the subject of an editorial saying that he was “catering to the worst side of Harvard students.” It was perhaps one of the shortest-lived websites in history, but we need to understand that beyond the adolescent-prank nature of it, Zuckerberg might have understood the basic narcissism of young people better than the editors of the <em class="calibre2">Harvard Crimson</em> did. After being put on probation by Harvard, he publicly apologized to women’s groups and agreed to see a counselor. He celebrated his light sentence with his roommates and a bottle of Dom Perignon. The excitement of making something that was immediately popular was in his brain. He wanted more.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Within a couple of months, he was building Thefacebook, the initial Harvard-only version of the platform that now has 1.5 billion users. Thefacebook was not the first social network—Friendster already had more than 3 million users, and Myspace was just getting started. But Zuckerberg understood three things that helped him succeed where the first movers would fail. First was simplicity of design. The clean look of Thefacebook contrasted with the cluttered, almost anarchic design of Myspace. What Myspace thought was a positive feature (the ability for anyone to elaborately design his or her own page) turned out to be a bug. The simplicity also made the server load less problematic. The pages loaded quickly, whereas Friendster often took a minute or more to load. Zuckerberg knew the average multitasking college student was borderline ADHD, so speed was critical.</p>
<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-148"></a>The second thing Zuckerberg understood was that by releasing the service only on elite college campuses (he launched in most of the Ivy League schools within two months), he could not only appeal to the snobbism of students but also take advantage of the dense social networks that are native to college campuses. The desire to know what your friends are doing on a Thursday night is probably more intense on a college campus than it is at any other location. Also, by controlling the rollout, he was able to avoid the technical crashes that had hurt Friendster. It allowed Zuckerberg and his roommates (who had joined the company) to achieve critical mass without spending millions of dollars on server capacity.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Finally, Thefacebook team grasped the inherent utility that the site would serve. In a piece published in the <em class="calibre2">Harvard Crimson</em> only two weeks after the site went live, Amelia Lester wrote, “There’s little wonder why Harvard students, in particular, find the opportunity to fashion an online persona such a tantalizing prospect.… [Thefacebook is] about performing and letting the world know we’re important individuals. In short, it’s what Harvard students do best.” But it turned out it wasn’t just elite Harvard kids who wanted to fashion an online persona—it was everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When Thefacebook really started to grow, in the late spring of 2004, Zuckerberg and his right-hand man, Dustin Moskovitz, decided to go to Silicon Valley for the summer. Zuckerberg had met Sean Parker in a Chinese restaurant in New York in May and had been awed by his outlaw tales of <a id="page-149"></a>Napster. Zuckerberg had written a music-recommendation engine while he was a senior at Exeter, and so Napster loomed large in his notion of hipness. When the two men got to Palo Alto in June, they ran into Parker, who was essentially homeless, having been thrown out of his latest company, Plaxo, an online address-book application. It is a tribute to Zuckerberg’s naive trust that he invited Parker to live in the house he and Moskovitz had rented. Parker promised to teach them about the shark tank known as Sand Hill Road—the center of the Valley’s venture capital business. In that role he did two important things. First, he kept Zuckerberg centered on Facebook, even though the young coder was spending a lot of time writing another program called Wirehog, which was essentially a version of Napster. Parker convinced him that it would be nothing but trouble in the form of lawsuits from the content community. The genius of Facebook was that the users provided all the content. There was no need to steal pictures, as he had for Facemash, or music files, as Parker had done for Napster. The second thing Parker did was to introduce Zuckerberg to Peter Thiel.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Peter Thiel grasped almost immediately the potential of Facebook. As David Kirkpatrick explained in <em class="calibre2">The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World,</em> “What happened once it opened at a new school was what most impressed Thiel. Within days it typically captured essentially the entire student body, and more than 80 percent of users returned to the site daily!” This was unprecedented, and Thiel knew that Facebook fit <a id="page-150"></a>all four of his success categories. It had proprietary technology with network effects that could scale, and it had a good brand. Sean Parker then solidified the brand identity by getting Zuckerberg to drop “The” from the name. It then became just Facebook. Thiel immediately gave the company a loan of $500,000, which was convertible into 10 percent of the stock. He did it as a loan because Zuckerberg had a lot of messes to clean up with Harvard students who claimed that he had stolen their idea.</p>
