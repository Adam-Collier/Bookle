<p class="hanging">Scott Cleland’s <em class="calibre2">Precursor</em> blog at www.precursorblog.com is a valuable resource for anyone studying Google. Cleland has pointed out that Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple are about to engage in a new war for our attention, using voice-activated “digital assistants” placed around the home to perceive our desires. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told attendees of their I/O developer conference in May 2016 that “Our ability to do conversational understanding is far ahead of what other assistants can do. We’re an order of magnitude ahead of everyone else.” The future is here, where not just your Android smartphone or your Google Home assistant, but your Nest thermostat and security cam and your Google TV set can report your every movement and conversation back to Google servers—all to better sell advertising and products. We continue to surrender more of our private lives while believing in the myth of convenience donated for free by benign corporations.</p>
