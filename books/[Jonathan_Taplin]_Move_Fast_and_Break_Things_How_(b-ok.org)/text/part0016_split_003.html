<p class="noindent">Perhaps the Internet’s greatest failing is the convergence of anonymity and misogyny. When Peter Thiel noted that giving the vote to women in the 1920s “rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron,” he was reiterating a basic Randian trope—men are makers and women are takers. In tech employment, women make up 29 percent of the workforce even though they comprise 47 percent of the US labor force, according to the US Census Bureau. Even more troubling is that women led only 8 percent of all start-ups funded by venture capitalists in 2015. But what is most disturbing are the attitudes toward women that get displayed in an incident like Gamergate.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Zoe Quinn was an oddity, a twenty-eight-year-old female video-game developer. Her life was good until she split with her boyfriend, as the <em class="calibre2">Washington Post</em> tells it:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Since August 2014, when her ex-boyfriend, Eron Gjoni, posted a 9,000-word screed about her online, Quinn and her <a id="page-219"></a>family had been deluged by threats so severe that Quinn fled her home in Boston, afraid for her life. Gjoni’s online “hate mob,” as Quinn described it to a municipal judge that September, had unearthed her address and old nude photos, hacked her website, promised to kill and rape her, and placed multiple threatening calls to her father’s home in upstate New York—all of which Quinn had meticulously documented and organized in evidentiary zip-drive folders.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">But the problem wasn’t just the scorned lover. It was the Internet mob of young men with a deep hatred of women and their efforts to be part of the gaming community. Because other women came to Zoe’s defense, the mob has “morphed into a neo-reactionary movement, bent largely on fighting ‘social justice warriors’ online.” But for the young men spending hours harassing Zoe Quinn, it is feminism that is the problem. Of course Peter Thiel felt this back in the early 1990s when he wrote in the <em class="calibre2">Stanford Review</em> that “the passionate hatred of men, the utopian demands for an elimination of all gender differences and the belief in widespread gender discrimination” were the biggest problems on the Stanford campus. He felt that this political correctness had to end.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The next generation of radical libertarians has called itself the alternative right, though many have noted this is just a less offensive title than “fascist.” Milo Yiannopoulos, the Breitbart News Network columnist who was Eron Gjoni’s biggest defender, described a characteristic of the group: “The alt-right’s intellectuals would also argue that culture is inseparable from race. The alt-right believe that <a id="page-220"></a>some degree of separation between peoples is necessary for a culture to be preserved. A Mosque next to an English street full of houses bearing the flag of St. George, according to alt-righters, is neither an English street nor a Muslim street—separation is necessary for distinctiveness.” Asked why he supported Trump, Milo replied, “Trump represents the best hope we have of smashing political correctness apart.… I want a new political re-alignment on libertarian-authoritarian lines rather than left and right.” And when Trump hired the CEO of Breitbart, Steve Bannon, to run his campaign, a <em class="calibre2">Washington Post</em> columnist noted that it represented “the dangerous seizure of the conservative movement by the Alt-Right.” But for Milo, Peter Thiel is a hero on par with Trump for funding the Hulk Hogan lawsuit against <em class="calibre2">Gawker</em>. “With his lawsuit,” he wrote, “Thiel has perhaps done more than any man to liberate social media from the terror of left-wing public shaming that prevailed in the golden age of Gawker. Indeed, nothing underscores the end of the reign of Gawker more than the rise of the alternative right, who cannot even be shamed by conservative media.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">The distance from Thiel to the alt-right is not long, but the terms of engagement have changed. At first Thiel signed his opinions proudly (both in the <em class="calibre2">Stanford Review</em> and in his books), but then, like most alt-right posters (with the exception of Milo), Thiel tried to hide his involvement through anonymity—as did the young man who wrote Zoe Quinn, “I’m not going to stop spreading your disgusting nudes around and making sure your life is a living hell until you either kill yourself or I rape you to death.” <a id="page-221"></a>When the police actually found some of the worst of Zoe’s harassers, they couldn’t arrest them because they were only thirteen years old.</p>
