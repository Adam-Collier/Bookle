<p class="noindent">Engelbart’s vision of the world was about to be eclipsed by a more commercially oriented one. Stewart Brand began hanging out with the PARC team and eventually wrote an article for <em class="calibre2">Rolling Stone</em> called “Spacewar: Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death Among the Computer Bums.” It starts like this.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Ready or not, computers are coming to the people.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">That’s good news, maybe the best since psychedelics. It’s way off the track of the “Computers—Threat or menace?” school of liberal criticism but surprisingly in line with the romantic fantasies of the forefathers of the science such as Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, J.C.R. Licklider, John von Neumann and Vannevar Bush. The trend owes its health to an odd array of influences: The youthful fervor and firm dis-Establishmentarianism of the freaks who design computer science; an astonishingly enlightened research program from the very top of the Defense Department; an unexpected market-Banking movement by the manufacturers of small calculating machines; and an irrepressible midnight phenomenon known as Spacewar.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-57"></a>Brand here was tying the networked computer revolution directly to the counterculture he was championing in the <em class="calibre2">Whole Earth Catalog</em>. And while he proclaimed that this revolution was the best news “since psychedelics,” he was fully aware that PARC was filled with video-gaming freaks financed by the Pentagon. The image makers at Xerox headquarters back East practically had a heart attack and decreed that there should be no more reporters at PARC. But Alan Kay—the young team leader who had envisioned the Dynabook, the first iteration of a PC, while he was still a PhD candidate—didn’t care. They were proud to fly their freak flag at PARC. Kay’s real passion was to design an educational tool using Engelbart’s basic ideas but putting an enhanced emphasis on the graphical user interface (GUI). Despite resistance from some of PARC’s management, Kay managed to assemble a small team to build the Alto—the first <em class="calibre2">real</em> personal computer. It had a mouse, a GUI that looks much like the one on your Mac, an Ethernet connection so it could link to other computers, and a printer. Xerox’s first reaction was “Couldn’t it be used by four people?” The company’s executives missed the whole point: it was a personal communication and creativity device. The first demonstration had <em class="calibre2">Sesame Street</em>’s Cookie Monster holding a cookie with one hand and then bringing up the letter <em class="calibre2">C</em> in the other. Kay knew that a first grader could manipulate a computer that had a simple GUI and a mouse.</p>
<p class="calibre5">John Seely Brown, who was to become director of PARC, told me that two principles were at the center of the PARC philosophy. To begin with, Bob Taylor had <a id="page-58"></a>brought the core directive of ARPANET with him to PARC. As Brown notes, “Decentralization was fundamental to ARPANET in the sense that a nuclear strike on a single city could not bring down the entire network.” Everything done at PARC, from the Alto to Bob Metcalf’s Ethernet architecture, was geared to making a decentralized network of personal computers function efficiently. This was new. The second core principle flowed from Alan Kay’s Dynabook. As Brown says, “The Dynabook and then the Alto were inspirations meant to empower the artistic individual.” When Brown first started working with Kay, he was playing music on the Alto and working with Stanford’s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. These two innovations—a decentralized network and a personal creativity machine—became the core of the Internet revolution. Despite the revolution’s value, the culture of PARC—which Brown describes as being one of “long hair and no shoes”—was a bit of a mismatch for Xerox. But the culture clash was not just about hippies versus suits. Brown explains: “Xerox built big complicated stuff that sold for $250,000 a unit and came with three-year guarantees. What was the chance that any of the PARC stuff could ever be sold through the Xerox channels? Zero.” So the decision was made to try to partner with Apple.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Almost every version of the story of Steve Jobs visiting PARC for a demonstration in December of 1979 is wrong. It is usually said to epitomize the complete failure on Xerox’s part to understand what they had invented. A <a id="page-59"></a>bit of background: Apple had successfully launched the Apple II computer in April of 1977. It was an instant hit, and between September of 1977 and September of 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533 percent. But Jobs refused to sit still. He had heard about the Xerox Alto and had worked out a deal with Xerox in which he would sell them perhaps as much as 5 percent of Apple in return for a licensing agreement to all the PARC technology. But in a true sign of how dysfunctional Xerox management was, it did not inform the PARC executives of the pending stock transaction. Xerox merely informed them that Jobs was going to come to PARC and that they should give him a demonstration.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Alan Kay and the group complied with the request, but they did not “open the kimono” in any way. Jobs left in a rage and called Xerox. The next day he returned, and a chastened PARC team showed him everything. Jobs went back to Cupertino and called a board meeting, saying he had to build a new computer based on the PARC architecture and that it should not be backward-compatible with the existing Apple II. The board thought he was crazy, but Jobs applied his charisma—his “reality distortion field”—and got his way. Xerox got its Apple shares, and in December of 1980, Apple went public at $22 per share. Xerox’s holdings were instantly worth millions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The first version of a computer using the PARC architecture, the Lisa, was a commercial failure, but when Jobs introduced the Macintosh in an iconic advertisement that <a id="page-60"></a>aired during the 1984 Super Bowl, the long-awaited vision of the future arrived. The tragedy for Xerox was that two years later, the Xerox CFO sold all its Apple stock. Imagine what it would have meant to the company if it had held on to 5 percent of Apple, which would now be worth about $32 billion. In 1985, after the debut of the Macintosh, Microsoft quickly introduced Windows, an operating system that totally mimicked the Macintosh. Whatever advantage Apple had was quickly extinguished, and Steve Jobs was forced out of the company.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Jobs immediately set out for revenge on his old company by building a new computer called NeXT. Not long after that, a twenty-nine-year-old English engineer, Tim Berners-Lee, took up a position at the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN). The Internet at this point was purely an academic research network linking physicists around the world and allowing them to share research documents, and CERN was the largest European node of the network. Finding documents was getting increasingly dicey as the network got more popular, so Berners-Lee began to work on the concept of hypertext as a way for researchers to link directly to other documents in their references. Coincidentally, he and Steve Jobs crossed paths at the very moment of the birth of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In late 1988, Mike Sendall, Berners-Lee’s boss at CERN, bought a NeXT cube to evaluate. A few months later, Berners-Lee had an idea to combine hypertext and the Internet and submitted it to Sendall. Sendall approved the <a id="page-61"></a>proposal and gave Berners-Lee the NeXT cube to play with. Berners-Lee’s colleague Robert Cailliau told the story:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Tim’s prototype implementation on NeXTStep is made in the space of a few months, thanks to the qualities of the NeXTStep software development system. This prototype offers WYSIWYG browsing/authoring! Current Web browsers used in “surfing the Internet” are mere passive windows, depriving the user of the possibility to contribute. During some sessions in the CERN cafeteria, Tim and I try to find a catching name for the system. I was determined that the name should not yet again be taken from Greek mythology… Tim proposes “World-Wide Web”. I like this very much, except that it is difficult to pronounce in French.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">So the World Wide Web changed everything, and Steve Jobs’s “what you see is what you get” (WYSIWYG) interface helped make it possible. Hyperlinking and open access became easy. But for Berners-Lee today there is some regret as he looks back at the birth of the Web. The Web was built to decentralize power and create open access, yet, he noted, “popular and successful services (search, social networking, email) have achieved near-monopoly status. Although industry leaders often spur positive change, we must remain wary of concentrations of power.” Notice the tentative voice: he doesn’t mention Google and Facebook by name. Tim Berners-Lee never got rich on his invention. He gave it to the world for free, so he remains dependent on research funding from giant corporations.</p>
