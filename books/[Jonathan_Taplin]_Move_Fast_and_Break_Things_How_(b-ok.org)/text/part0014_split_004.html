<p class="noindent">The ability of criminal gangs to achieve extraordinary productivity by using the Internet is quite remarkable. In the winter of 2015, it was discovered that a group of Russian hackers had been able to transfer $1 billion out of one hundred banks over the course of two years. The plot, discovered by the international cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, involved planting malware in hundreds of banks’ money-transfer systems and ordering the banks to make large transfers to dummy accounts set up by the cyberthieves. Once the money was in the accounts, they were closed out, and the cash disappeared. Kaspersky noted, “The plot marks the beginning of a new stage in the evolution of cybercriminal activity, where malicious users steal money directly from banks, and avoid targeting end users.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Imagine the number of man-hours and the risk associated with trying to rob $1.1 billion in traditional bank holdups. But it is in the area of terrorism that the productivity of the Internet becomes truly frightening. Imagine if you were a terrorist organization in 1990 wanting to get a propaganda video you made viewed by two million people. <a id="page-183"></a>The task would be almost impossible. As Osama bin Laden did in the early days, you might try to distribute videos via street vendors. You certainly couldn’t get access to any television network, either in the West or in the Islamic world. But today ISIS can make a video, post it for free on YouTube, and get two million views in a week—especially if it involves something horrific like a beheading. In 2015 ISIS supporters had over 46 thousand accounts on Twitter, and posted 90 thousand tweets a day. In 2013 there were more than 35 thousand ISIS videos on YouTube. Why are we allowing this to happen? Because Twitter and YouTube hide behind the First Amendment in furtherance of their business model. <em class="calibre2">BuzzFeed</em>’s Charlie Warzel describes a meeting at Twitter between former CEO Dick Costolo and Twitter’s free speech advocates Gabriel Stricker and Vijaya Gadde, who were refusing to take down the ISIS beheading videos.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">“You really think we should have videos of people being murdered?” someone who attended the meeting recalls Costolo arguing, while Stricker reportedly compared Costolo’s takedown of undesirable content to deleting the Zapruder film after objections from the Kennedy family. Ultimately, the meeting ended with the group deciding to carve out policy exceptions to keep up grisly content for newsworthiness, according to one person present. Though Stricker and Gadde won, one source described a frustrated Costolo leaving in disagreement. “I think if you guys have your way the only people using Twitter will be ISIS and the ACLU,” Costolo said, according to this person.</p>

<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-184"></a>Former Supreme Court justice Robert Jackson once wrote, “The Constitution is not a suicide pact,” but one would be hard-pressed to not realize that jihadists are using social media as a key component of their attack on civilization. Without YouTube and Twitter, their global propaganda machine could not function.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While it might seem like a stretch, the DMCA imposes no obligation on Twitter and YouTube to remove either offensive content or copyrighted material. Under the act’s “safe harbor” provisions, any service or site that makes a minimal effort to address the concerns of copyright holders is immune from liability for piracy or theft. That system may have made sense when it took several minutes to download an illegal song. But today no individual can effectively police the millions of pirated files that mushroom online and reappear the instant they are taken down. Google alone received almost 560 million takedown notices in 2015.</p>
<p class="calibre5">YouTube claims it has no control over what users post on its platform, but this not true. You will notice that there is no porn on the platform. YouTube has very sophisticated content ID tools that screen for porn before it can ever be posted. These same tools could be used to screen out posts from ISIS before they appear. But YouTube does not want to change the status quo because its advertising-based business model relies on having the maximum number of users and the maximum number of posts. YouTube has even gone so far as to place ads on ISIS videos. On the next page is a Bounty paper towel ad on a video aimed at ISIS’s teenage fans.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In an effort to curtail ISIS’s use of YouTube, the Obama administration sent its top national security team to Silicon Valley in January of 2016 to try to get Google and other tech giants to use their pornography-filtering tools to block terrorist videos. The request got a very frosty reception from YouTube. And even though Google wouldn’t comment on the meeting, Emma Llanso, a director at the Center for Democracy and Technology—a think tank Google helps finance—spoke for the tech community. The answer was straight out of the libertarian playbook: “It’s a slippery slope with free speech where if you start making exceptions, where do you stop and where do you draw the line?” In April of 2016, when the register of copyrights for the United States, Maria Pallante, decided to request comments about whether the DMCA’s “safe harbor” provisions should be modified, Google went back to the same playbook it had used to fight the Stop Online Piracy Act. Using a proxy organization, a fund called Fight for the Future, it generated thousands of automated comments on the Regulations.gov website opposing any changes to the DMCA. Fight for the Future boasted to <em class="calibre2">TorrentFreak,</em> “The flood of new submissions over the last several hours appears to have repeatedly crashed the website that the government set up to receive feedback.” In a sad postscript to Pallente’s efforts to change the DMCA, Google and their ally Public Knowledge created a campaign to push Pallante out of the office that controls copyright policy. Pallante was fired in October of 2016.</p>
