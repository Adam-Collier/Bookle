<h2 class="sect3" id="calibre_pb_4">Chapter Two: Levon’s Story</h2>
<p class="hanging">Though most of the story of Levon Helm and The Band comes from my own experience with them, there are two good books on that period in Woodstock by British journalist Barney Hoskins: <em class="calibre2">Across the Great Divide: The Band &amp; America</em> (New York: Hal Leonard, 2006) covers most of their career. <em class="calibre2">Small Town Talk: Bob Dylan, The Band, Van Morrison, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and Friends in the Wild Years of Woodstock</em> (New York: Da Capo Press, 2016) has a much wider view of the whole scene in late 1960s Woodstock.</p>
<p class="hanging">Chris Anderson’s book from 2008, <em class="calibre2">The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More</em> (New York: Hachette, 2008) is still fairly controversial. I believe he underestimated the power of search engines to push only the most popular content to the top.</p>
<p class="hanging">The best recording ever of Ray Charles is <em class="calibre2">Ray Charles Live</em> from a 1959 Atlanta stadium show with a big band. This is where you can find the inexorably cathartic and impossibly slow “Drown in My Own Tears.”</p>
