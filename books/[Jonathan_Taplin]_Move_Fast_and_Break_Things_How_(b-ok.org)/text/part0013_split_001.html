<p class="noindent">Yael Maguire, director of Facebook’s Connectivity Lab, is making a presentation to a <em class="calibre2">Fast Company</em> reporter. “There is only 10 percent of the world that is not able to connect if they pulled out a phone. Our job is to figure out how to connect the last 10 percent.” His solution: the prototype of the Aquila, an ultra-lightweight carbon-fiber drone with a 138-foot wingspan (a Boeing 737 has a 113-foot wingspan) that weighs only 880 pounds. With the right battery technology, the drone should be able to hover for three months over a remote village in India and provide a basic Internet service Facebook calls Free Basics. No one ever said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg lacked ambition.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But now citizens of that remote village are about to <a id="page-144"></a>enter the surveillance society that billions of us have been inhabiting since 2000. “Who could possibly be against this?” Zuckerberg asked in an editorial in the <em class="calibre2">Times of India</em> on December 28, 2015. As it turns out, many in India were opposed. According to an article in <em class="calibre2">The Economist,</em> “Critics of the program say that Facebook’s generosity is cover for a land grab. They argue that Free Basics is a walled garden of Facebook-approved content, that it breaches consumer privacy by sucking up all the data generated by users of the service, and that it is anticompetitive to boot.” When the Indian government finally ruled that Facebook should not be able to “shape users’ Internet experience” by providing only a limited set of sites, Facebook board member Marc Andreessen was outraged, tweeting, “Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?” But even Andreessen was shocked by the backlash to his tweet, much of it from the Indian tech community in Silicon Valley. He unwittingly revealed a previously unspoken truth: Facebook and Google are the new colonial powers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The battle for world domination is on. If Google’s Larry Page worries about any competitor, it is probably Mark Zuckerberg. While Facebook began as a way to make social networks visible and to ease communication between them, it is now—like Google—in the surveillance marketing business. Facebook and Google sell the data you give them to marketers. Google gets the data through your search history. Facebook gets it through your social media posts. The scale of the Facebook ecosystem—which includes WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram—is <a id="page-145"></a>astonishing: 1.6 billion users of Facebook itself; 1 billion on WhatsApp; 900 million on Messenger; 400 million on Instagram. Facebook controls more than 75 percent of US mobile social media platforms. Under any normal antitrust regime this would be considered a monopoly. Like Google, Facebook has taken to presenting itself as a public service. “Don’t be evil.” “Who could be against it?” But a 2014 survey by online identity manager MyLife shows that 82.9 percent of those polled said that they did not trust Facebook with their personal data. I am a Facebook user, and in many ways I think it is a wonderful tool for communication. I also suspect you will find that Mark Zuckerberg, the brash young man who founded the company at the age of twenty, is growing up and becoming aware of the awesome responsibilities he has in running the world’s largest social network.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The bratty kid portrayed in the movie <em class="calibre2">The Social Network</em> may have been changed by marriage and fatherhood. Larry Page, Peter Thiel, and Jeff Bezos are in their forties and fifties. Their libertarian ideals are fairly fixed, but watching the evolution of Mark Zuckerberg over the past ten years is to see a maturation process in both the man and his company. I may be a fool—perhaps he doesn’t really believe that his job is to bring the twenty-first century to the four billion people who remain offline. But even if I’m wrong, and this is all some amazing publicity stunt, the process of connecting two billion people on one site will force Zuckerberg to deal with three critical elements of our story: the role of privacy in our lives, the role advertising will play in the media landscape, and the future of communications.</p>
