<p class="noindent">The founding of Google is one of the key moments in the history of the Internet, and so it is important to take some time to understand its philosophical principles. As Ken Auletta pointed out in his book <em class="calibre2">Googled: The End of the World as We Know It,</em> Page and Brin never asked for permission to copy the entire World Wide Web onto their servers and then index it. Ayn Rand’s famous quotation “Who will stop me?” seems to be the founding principle of Google. Page’s constant assurances in his initial shareholder letter that everyone should trust his and Brin’s good intentions are critical to this Randian mind-set: “Don’t be evil. We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served—as shareholders and in all other ways—by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains. This is an important aspect of our culture and is broadly shared within the company.” This naïveté, this barely disguised will to power, this dialectic—Google will do whatever it wants without asking permission, and the results will be so awesome that no <a id="page-98"></a>one will complain—stands at the heart of the company’s success. Gmail and Google Street View are two examples. The trade-off Google offered customers—allow Google to scan all your email (so they can place customized advertising on it) in return for a gigabyte of free storage—is not something users would have accepted if the company had asked permission up front. The offer was free email with unlimited storage. The fine print said, in effect, “You give us permission to read your mail in order to sell you stuff.” In addition, customers were not asked if the Google Street View camera could take a picture of their front yards and match it to their addresses.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But Page seems unconscious of the irony of the dialectic. He has stated, “For me, privacy and security are a really important thing. We think about it in terms of both things, and I think you can’t have privacy without security.” But no one has done more to eliminate the notion of privacy than Larry Page. For the first two years of Gmail, Page refused to put a Delete button on the service, because Google’s ability to profile you by preserving your correspondence was more important than your ability to eliminate embarrassing parts of your past. The data smog you leave behind was also so crucial to “personalized search” that Google chairman Eric Schmidt told <em class="calibre2">The Atlantic,</em> “We don’t need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you’ve been. We can more or less know what you’re thinking about.” In Europe, Google continues to challenge “the right to be forgotten”—customers’ ability to eliminate false articles written about them from Google’s search engine.</p>
<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-99"></a>Google took a similar “don’t ask permission” tack when Brin decided to digitize all the world’s books. As he told Auletta, if they had asked authors and publishers, Google “might not have done the project.” This same dynamic plays itself out on Google’s YouTube platform, where the company has somehow managed to make it the responsibility of the content owner to police the site for copyright infringement. YouTube watch time is growing 60 percent year over year, and revenues could reach $12 billion in 2017. Because of the “don’t ask permission” policy, every single tune in the world is available on YouTube as a simple audio file (most of them posted by users). So as the following chart shows, YouTube is the largest streaming music site in the world, with a 52 percent market share, even though it pays only 13 percent of the streaming music revenues that the music business does.</p>

<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-100"></a>The cofounder of YouTube, Chad Hurley, was a PayPal alumnus, schooled in Peter Thiel’s philosophy. He built his company on the same “don’t ask permission” ethic that Larry Page had embraced. Emails released during one of the early copyright infringement lawsuits against the company make it clear that Hurley knew he was building his business on illegal conduct. In a June 15, 2005, email to his cofounders, Hurley writes, “So, a way to avoid the copyright bastards might be to remove the ‘No copyrighted or obscene material’ line and let the users moderate the videos themselves. Legally, this will probably be better for us, as we’ll make the case we can review all videos and tell them if they’re concerned they have the tools to do it themselves.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Here Hurley shows an early appreciation of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which Bill Clinton had signed into law just weeks after Google went live on the Web. The statute protected online service providers (OSPs) such as Google and YouTube from copyright infringement prosecution provided that the OSP not have the requisite level of knowledge of the infringing activity… not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity [and] upon receiving proper notification of claimed infringement… expeditiously take down or block access to the material. Since Hurley’s 2005 email, this has been YouTube’s strategy: pretend not to know there is infringing material being uploaded by users and take down the content when notified by the copyright owner. But this of course neglects one crucial provision of the DMCA—does YouTube receive financial benefit directly attributable to the presence of <a id="page-101"></a>infringing content on the site? The answer, of course, is yes: in fact you could argue that YouTube achieved success in a crowded field precisely because of its laxity toward pirated content. Competitors such as Yahoo and RealNetworks were thinking they were in a boxing match, where there were rules, while YouTube was performing in a professional wrestling match, where there are no rules.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In another email exchange from 2005, when full-length movies were being posted on YouTube, Steve Chen, a cofounder of the company, wrote to his colleagues Hurley and Jawed Karim, “Steal it!,” and Chad Hurley responded: “Hmm, steal the movies?” Steve Chen replied: “We have to keep in mind that we need to attract traffic. How much traffic will we get from personal videos? Remember, the only reason why our traffic surged was due to a video of this type.… viral videos will tend to be THOSE type of videos.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">A year after all these emails were written, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock. But the predatory conduct did not stop. In the <em class="calibre2">Viacom International, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc.</em> lawsuit discovery, a June 8, 2006, presentation outlining YouTube’s content strategy was uncovered. It was sent by Google senior vice president of product management Jonathan Rosenberg to Google CEO Eric Schmidt and Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and it said, in part, that Google must “pressure premium content providers to change their model towards free[;] Adopt ‘or else’ stance re prosecution of copyright infringement elsewhere[;] Set up ‘play first, deal later’ around ‘hot content.’” It also said that Google “may be able to coax or force access to viral premium content,” <a id="page-102"></a>“threaten a change in copyright policy,” and “use threat to get deal sign-up.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course Google wasn’t quite as cavalier with its own intellectual property. As their IPO prospectus had warned, “Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and all of our other intellectual property rights are important assets for us.… Any significant impairment to our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.”</p>
