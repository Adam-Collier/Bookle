<p class="noindent">Finally, in order to create a new American renaissance, we need a really good public media system. What I am imagining is a single well-funded TV, radio, and Internet service that integrates content and stories across all three platforms. The best current example I can point to is the BBC. Every British household pays a small yearly fee that finances the whole system. In the United States, we could raise this money in several ways: a spectrum tax that broadcasters would pay for the use of public airwaves; a small tax on advertising revenue, which could easily pay for an advertising-free zone on public media; or selling much of the spectrum controlled by local PBS stations and putting the money in a production trust that would throw off enough income to pay for yearly production expenses.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The key to a vital public media system is the balance <a id="page-274"></a>between local and global. My sense is that National Public Radio is doing a good job at this balance. Today NPR has 36.6 million listeners for its radio programming and 33.2 million viewers of its Web content. My local NPR station, KCRW, in Santa Monica, is a strong example of this local-global strategy. In addition to broadcasting national programs from NPR, American Public Media, and Public Radio International, KCRW produces four daily programs, eight weekly shows, and twenty-eight podcasts covering news, politics, entertainment, music, film, food, literature, design, architecture, and storytelling—all on an annual budget of $22 million. It has become the source of my continuing music education as well as the way I learn more about local food, art, and culture than I ever could from any other source, including the <em class="calibre2">Los Angeles Times</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But while NPR is thriving, public television is a total mess. PBS has 350 stations, whereas a network like NBC has only 220 affiliates. This matters a lot, because the majority of the money that the government-funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting doles out every year goes to local stations, not to national programming. Not only is PBS starved for programming funds, there is also no innovation on the national programming schedule. PBS’s anchor programs—<em class="calibre2">Masterpiece, Frontline, Nova,</em> and <em class="calibre2">PBS NewsHour</em>—have all been going for at least twenty-five years. Even <em class="calibre2">Sesame Street</em> has defected to HBO as a showcase for its first-run content. There has not been a successful new series in the last fifteen years.</p>
<p class="calibre5">PBS needs to radically shrink the number of stations it funds. Perhaps the model of having only a single public <a id="page-275"></a>television station in every state, as there is in Vermont, points the way forward. Since 90 percent of TV viewers are getting the programming through cable or satellite, one could easily place repeater transmission towers around the state to reach the folks who are still using antennas. If PBS shrank the number of stations and used the money from spectrum sales and government grants for programming, we would have a genuine alternative to commercially sponsored TV in America. The strategy of investing in programming has worked in England: figures show that the commercial-free BBC networks had a weekly reach in April and June of 2015 encompassing 78.8 percent of the British TV audience, which spent an average of nine and a half hours per week on the networks. Needless to say, much of the BBC’s programming investments end up as the best shows on PBS.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What intrigues me about the BBC model is that we need to break the grip of advertising on our media system. Advertisers have a natural bias against controversy—edgy art does not help sell sugar water. But the story of progress in art is all about edgy material. Imagine Picasso having to persuade an executive at Pernod to support his earliest cubist paintings. Or a Coca-Cola marketer in Chicago listening to Louis Armstrong’s breakthrough “West End Blues” and wondering, “Will it help sell soda?” I think the growth of advertising in our time is symbolic of a deep crisis in capitalism. I have written earlier in this book of the great stagnation—the period since the early 1970s when median wages refused to rise even though productivity was rising dramatically. In the face of such wage stagnation, firms have to spend more money on marketing to get <a id="page-276"></a>consumers to keep buying. As you wander down the supermarket aisle perusing endless varieties of detergent, all basically containing the same ingredients, the only distinguishing factor is the marketing pitch. Will Tide get my shirts cleaner than Surf? Behind most detergent brands are just two firms, Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever, each of which spends more than $8 billion per year on advertising.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As this stagnation—unbelievably—continues, the need for more intrusive “behavioral marketing” increases, and the Internet is the conduit for most of that—both on the demand side and the supply side. The supply is the constant surveillance of your data on billions of smartphones. The demand is advertisers’ endless need to send messaging that recognizes the time of day, your mood, your device, and your geographic location. As early as the mid-1950s, the economist John Kenneth Galbraith suggested that there would come a time when “it can no longer be assumed that welfare is greater at an all-around higher level of production than at a lower one.… The higher level of production has, merely, a higher level of want creation necessitating a higher level of want satisfaction.” Galbraith’s assertion perfectly captures the goal of modern advertising: to create desire for products we didn’t know we needed. The American middle class is in the same position as a hamster on a wheel: running faster and faster but making no progress in relation to its neighbors. Galbraith could have never imagined the heights of want creation that Facebook could deliver when it’s viewed on a mobile device we cannot ignore.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I was at the monastery in Big Sur, I read a book by <a id="page-277"></a>E. F. Schumacher called <em class="calibre2">Small Is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered.</em> One passage stood out for me as I was contemplating whether our smartphones were liberating us or just addicting us to more consumption:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">[The modern Western economist] is used to measuring the “standard of living” by the amount of annual consumption, assuming all the time that a man who consumes more is “better off” than a man who consumes less. A Buddhist economist would consider this approach excessively irrational: since consumption is merely a means to human well-being, the aim should be to obtain the maximum of well-being with the minimum of consumption.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">But the business models of Google, Amazon, and Facebook are all built around the assumption that they hold the secret formula to continually arousing our desires. This may not be good for America, but it’s good for Google, Amazon, and Facebook.</p>
