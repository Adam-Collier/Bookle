<p class="noindent">Upon their father’s death, Charles and David started to organize their own political movement. In an indication of how far to the right they were, Charles persuaded David to accept the Libertarian Party’s nomination for vice president so they could run to the right of Ronald Reagan in the presidential election of 1980. Before the existence of <a id="page-197"></a>Citizens United—the organization that won the 2010 Supreme Court decision allowing unlimited corporate contributions to political action committees—David funneled $2 million into the campaign to finance his own candidacy. The campaign was a total flameout, attracting only 1 percent of the vote. From that point on, Charles, who is the brains in the family and controls Koch Industries with an iron hand, declared he would never support a third party. He had only one choice—take over the Republican Party. He did this by essentially setting up an alternative party structure under Koch control. According to Jane Mayer, the Kochs’ advocacy group, Americans for Prosperity, has “become one of the most powerful political forces in the country… [employing] more than three times the number of people who work for the Republican National Committee.” By setting up a parallel party with unlimited funds, the Kochs were both driving the cost of elections higher and able to respond to this inflation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Critical to the success of Google, Facebook, and Amazon is the ability to maintain the illusion that they are working for the greater good even while pursuing policies that serve only their own needs. In an earlier time, we called this greenwashing. Jane Mayer quotes public-relations expert Fraser Seitel about the Koch brothers’ effort to remake their image: “They’re waging a charm offensive to reset the image of the Kochs from bogeymen shrouded in secrecy to philanthropists who are supporting black colleges and indigent defense.” By 2013 both Google and Facebook followed Koch Industries and joined the American <a id="page-198"></a>Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Founded in 1973 as the Conservative Caucus of State Legislators, ALEC states that its current goal is to further “the fundamental principles of limited government, free markets, and federalism.” ALEC is the principal climate-change opposition group at the state level, but it also has focused on “opposing insurance coverage for birth control in the US; opposing the individual health insurance mandate enacted by the Affordable Care Act; expanding the ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws that allow citizens the right to self-defense if they feel their property is under attack; prohibiting cities from building public broadband networks; urging state legislatures to demand voters produce state-issued IDs.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Many progressives questioned why Google and Facebook would join such a right-wing libertarian organization. But Robert McChesney, in his book <em class="calibre2">Digital Disconnect: How Capitalism Is Turning the Internet Against Democracy,</em> thinks he has the answer.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">It is true that with the advent of the Internet many of the successful giants—Apple and Google come to mind—were begun by idealists who may have been uncertain whether they really wanted to be old-fashioned capitalists. The system in short order has whipped them into shape. Any qualms about privacy, commercialism, avoiding taxes, or paying low wages to Third World factory workers were quickly forgotten. It is not that the managers are particularly bad and greedy people—indeed their individual moral makeup is mostly irrelevant—but rather that the system sharply rewards some types of behavior and penalizes <a id="page-199"></a>other types of behavior so that people either get with the program and internalize the necessary values or they fail.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Eventually the pressure from progressives was too much, and both Google and Facebook stopped funding ALEC. But the Kochs press on with their agenda.</p>
