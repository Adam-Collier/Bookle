<p class="noindent">We are trapped inside the libertarian economic and personal theories Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand created in the 1950s. For corporations, Friedman decreed, “there is one and only one social responsibility of business—to increase its profits.” Rand told individuals that “achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life.” As recently as the late 1970s these theories were viewed as the crackpot musings of reactionaries. A review of Rand’s essay collection <em class="calibre2">Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</em> in the <em class="calibre2">New Republic</em> simply referred to Rand as “Top Bee in the communal bonnet, buzzing the loudest and zaniest throughout this all but incredible book.” But since the <a id="page-28"></a>election of Ronald Reagan, these libertarian principles have won the Washington, DC, battle of ideas. Since then, notions that the state should regulate the free market have been out of favor in both Republican and Democratic administrations. It may be that the Great Recession of 2008 led many to realize that this philosophy is a dead end for both culture and politics, but we seem to be lacking the political and cultural will to direct society onto a new path. Nobel Prize–winning economist Joseph Stiglitz thinks we need to rethink the laissez-faire economics of Rand and Friedman: “If markets are based on exploitation, the rationale for laissez-faire disappears. Indeed, in that case, the battle against entrenched power is not only a battle for democracy; it is also a battle for efficiency and shared prosperity.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">It is important at the outset that we not assume that this technological revolution we are living through has but one inevitable outcome. I am reminded of the slogan British prime minister Margaret Thatcher used to use when talking about her program of deregulation and tax cuts for the rich: “TINA—There is no alternative.” But history is made by humans, not by corporations or machines. Digital-age robber barons tell us that everything is different now and that they deserve to win because they are smart enough to throw away conventional wisdom and embrace disruption. But a culture and its art are not like an old flip phone—to be thrown in the trash as soon as it has been “disrupted” by the Next Big Thing. Culture thrives on continuity. As Pete Seeger once said, “Every songwriter is just a link in the chain.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">A writer I greatly admire, the late Gabriel García Márquez, embodied, for me, the role of the artist in <a id="page-29"></a>society. His life and work were marked by the refusal to believe that we are incapable of creating a more just world. Utopias are out of favor now. Yet García Márquez never gave up believing in the transformative power of words to conjure magic and seize the imagination. He also taught us the importance of regionalism. In a commercial culture of sameness, where you can stroll through a mall in Shanghai and forget that you’re not in Los Angeles, García Márquez’s work was distinctly Latin American, as unique as the songs of Gilberto Gil or the cinema of Alejandro González Iñárritu. In a culture like ours, which has long advocated a “melting pot” philosophy that papers over differences, it is valuable to recognize that allowing our dissimilarities to act as barriers is not the same as appreciating the things that make each culture unique, situated in time and space and connected to a particular people. What’s more, young artists need to have the sense of history that García Márquez celebrated when he said, “I cannot imagine how anyone could even think of writing a novel without having at least a vague idea of the 10,000 years of literature that have gone before.” Cultural amnesia only leads to cultural death. If the only university students who receive state help are computer engineers, we as a culture will lose something.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But Google, YouTube, and Facebook treat cultural objects as commodities—click bait. The scholar James Delong suggests that Google’s principal mission is to commoditize the world’s media:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">In most circumstances, the commoditizer’s goal is restrained by knowledge that enough money must be left in the system <a id="page-30"></a>to support the creation of the complements. Google is in a different position. Its major complements already exist, and it need not worry in the short term about continuing the flow. For content, we have decades of music and movies that can be digitized and then distributed, with advertising attached [and data scraped for profiling]. A wealth of other works awaits digitizing—books, maps, visual arts, and so on. If these run out, Google and other Internet companies have hit on the concept of user-generated content and social networks, in which the users are sold to each other, with yet more advertising attached [and data mining]. So, on the whole, Google can continue to do well even if it leaves providers of its complements gasping like fish on a beach.</p>

<p class="calibre5">To understand how this profound shift affects all artists, I want to turn our attention to the late 1960s, when I was working as a tour manager for The Band—and occasionally for Bob Dylan, when it suited his aloof lifestyle. Whenever a musician complains about how he or she has been screwed by YouTube or Spotify, the standard response is something like this: “Oh, the music business has always screwed the musicians. What else is new?” But this is just not true. The music business worked remarkably well in the 1960s and 1970s. Everyone got paid, you made a decent return on your investment of time and toil as an artist, and record companies really helped you build a career. The individual artist was able to leverage the global distribution networks of the record companies, which in turn were able to nurture artists’ careers over multiple albums. Today the business is very different, as the musician David Byrne <a id="page-31"></a>explained in a <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> op-ed piece: “This should be the greatest time for music in history—more of it is being found, made, distributed and listened to than ever before… Everyone should be celebrating—but many of us who create, perform and record music are not… I myself am doing OK, but my concern is for the artists coming up: How will they make a life in music?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">If we are to have a moral framework for the digital economy, we need to answer this question.</p>
