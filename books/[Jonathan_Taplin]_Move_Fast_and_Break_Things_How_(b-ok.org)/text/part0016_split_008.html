<p class="noindent">In 1970 the Nobel Prize–winning economist George Akerlof published a paper that may help us understand the effect that the commoditization of media by Facebook, YouTube, and Google is having on our culture. The paper was called “The Market for ‘Lemons’: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism.” Akerlof says that when you buy a used car you assume the worst—it’s a lemon—in your negotiation stance. Thus the seller of a really good used car always loses out. No one will pay for more than average quality. The typical consumer of ad-supported media in our broadband universe is like that used-car buyer: he or she assumes that content is of average quality, and this inevitably gives rise to what Chris Anderson, in his book <em class="calibre2">Free: The Future of a Radical Price,</em> claims is a business strategy essential to companies’ survival—giving <a id="page-241"></a>things away. If the YouTube video I’m about to watch is free, I lose nothing except my time watching it. I can assume it is a lemon, or at the very least worthless. In a world where YouTube, Google, and Facebook treat all content as a commodity—a means to an end—it isn’t surprising that it’s devalued in the public mind. The false democracy that places art and random uploads side by side has, I believe, led too many to believe that art is easy to make and therefore not valuable. As James DeLong said, “Google can continue to do well even if it leaves providers of its [content] gasping like fish on a beach.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Once upon a time a critic such as Pauline Kael or Greil Marcus could help me navigate this information asymmetry, driving interest in work they deemed to be of quality. The hegemony of the blockbuster in music, books, and film allows marketers to bypass critics, rendering them almost irrelevant to the process. Do you think the producer of Michael Bay’s <em class="calibre2">Transformers</em> spends one minute worrying about critics? And don’t confuse the critics I’m talking about with the crowd at Rotten Tomatoes. The great critic Pauline Kael was someone I trusted deeply. She was not an algorithm, processing twenty thousand comments about a film. She made an argument concerning each film—passionately reasoned—whether she liked it or hated it. Each work of art had a reason for being, and in championing the good stuff, she made us all better filmmakers. By contrast, Leon Wieseltier asserted that current criticism is all about “takes”: “Make a smart remark and move on. A take is an opinion that has no aspiration to a belief, an impression that never hardens into a position.” <a id="page-242"></a>The Internet fostered the take. A whole movie reviewed in a single tweet. It may be quite easy to review the latest <em class="calibre2">Transformers</em> movie in 140 characters, but I doubt that would work for <em class="calibre2">The Big Short</em> or <em class="calibre2">Spotlight</em>. The rationale behind a comic-book movie or even a new PewDiePie YouTube episode is that a tweet or a thirty-second ad on the Internet will tell you all you need to know about it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So in the face of the commoditization of content on platforms like YouTube, I want to reassert that art is important. There is a sense in which art, politics, and economics are all inextricably and symbiotically tied together, but history has proved to us that art serves as a powerful corrective against the missteps of the establishment. There is a system of checks and balances in which, even though the arts may rely on the social structures afforded by strong economic and political systems, artists can inspire a culture to move forward, reject the evils of greed and prejudice, and reconnect to its human roots. This ability cannot be taught to a computer algorithm, despite what Veritas, a company that sells “information management solutions,” claims in a piece of “sponsored content” in the <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em>:</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Lynn [Joshua Lynn of Piedmont Media Research] and his team are hired by major studios to test out new movie concepts with sample audiences. They start by tabulating hundreds of reactions to a written movie concept that Lynn says is “almost a textual description of what we might get in a trailer.” The reactions are then analyzed to produce what the company calls a Consumer Engagement <a id="page-243"></a>Score—a number from one to 1,000 that shows how well audiences jibe with a concept, broken down by age, race, geographical location and other factors. Lynn says the score can predict a Hollywood hit with 89 percent accuracy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is of course total nonsense, but it is perhaps indicative of why our movie screens are flooded with look-alike comic-book-hero movies. You can call it what you want, but it is no longer the art of the cinema.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Those seeking political and economic change should consider embracing art. Part of our role as citizens is to look more closely at the media surrounding us and think critically about its effects—specifically, whose agenda is being promoted and whether it’s the agenda that will serve us best. In 2011, the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (<em class="calibre2">Being John Malkovich, Adaptation</em>) gave a lecture at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. He said something both simple and profound:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">People all over the world spend countless hours of their lives every week being fed entertainment in the form of movies, TV shows, newspapers, YouTube videos, and the Internet. And it’s ludicrous to believe that this stuff doesn’t alter our brains.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">It’s also equally ludicrous to believe that—at the very least—this mass distraction and manipulation is not convenient for the people who are in charge. People are starving. They may not know it because they’re being fed mass-produced garbage. The packaging is colorful and loud, but it’s produced in the same factories that make <a id="page-244"></a>Pop-Tarts and iPads by people sitting around thinking, “What can we do to get people to buy more of these?”</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">And they’re very good at their jobs. But that’s what it is you’re getting, because that’s what they’re making. They’re selling you something. And the world is built on this now. Politics and government are built on this; corporations are built on this. Interpersonal relationships are built on this. And we’re starving, all of us, and we’re killing each other, and we’re hating each other, and we’re calling each other liars and evil because it’s all become marketing and we want to win because we’re lonely and empty and scared and we’re led to believe winning will change all that. But there is no winning.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In his book <em class="calibre2">Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business,</em> Neil Postman compares two midcentury views of the future: George Orwell’s in <em class="calibre2">1984</em> and Aldous Huxley’s in <em class="calibre2">Brave New World</em>. Though Orwell’s dystopian nightmare is probably better known, Huxley’s vision, in my opinion, was more true to our current moment. Following is Postman’s beautiful summary:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. <a id="page-245"></a>Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Huxley’s assertion was that technology would lead to passivity. The ease with which we could consume mind-numbing entertainments and distractions would ultimately rot our democracy. And this is exactly what may be happening. In the 2016 presidential election in the United States, ninety-eight million citizens who were eligible to vote declined to exercise that privilege, according to the United States Elections Project. And a much larger percentage of millennials are nonvoters. As Kevin Drum reported in <em class="calibre2">Mother Jones,</em> “In 1967 there was very little difference between the youngest and oldest voters. By 1987 a gap had opened up, and by 2014 that gap had become a chasm.” As much as we can rail about the deleterious effects of the Koch brothers’ billions on the political process, if half the American electorate thinks that voting is a waste of time, we need to understand democracy’s failure. If most of those young nonvoters are on social media, then Facebook is at least partially to blame. In Huxley’s world, the obsession with taking drugs, going to the “feelies” (his equivalent of IMAX movies), playing interactive games, and downloading porn filled the lives of the citizens. They had no time for politics or even for wondering why their horizons were so narrow. The kids attending DigiTour would fit right into the plot of <em class="calibre2">Brave New World.</em> The Internet’s self-curated view from everywhere has the <a id="page-246"></a>amazing ability to distract us in trivial pursuits, narrow our choices, and keep us safe in a balkanized suburb of our own taste. Search engines and recommendation engines constantly favor the most popular options and constantly make our discovery more limited.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I began this chapter wondering whether technology was robbing us of some of our essential humanity. Google’s chief technologist proclaims that technology will “allow us to transcend these limitations of our biological bodies and brains.… There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine.” But the brilliant essayist Mark Greif notes, “Anytime your inquiries lead you to say, ‘At this moment we must ask and decide <em class="calibre2">who we fundamentally are,</em> our solution and salvation must lie in a new picture of ourselves and humanity, this is our profound responsibility and a new opportunity’—just stop.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">That is exactly what I propose: let’s stop and consider a strategy of resistance to techno-determinism. Any historian will tell you that revolutions often overshoot their marks, a statement the citizens of Paris in 1789 or Moscow in 1925 would have agreed with. The digital revolution is no exception.</p>
