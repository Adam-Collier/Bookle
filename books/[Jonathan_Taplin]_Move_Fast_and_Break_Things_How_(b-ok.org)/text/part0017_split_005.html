<p class="noindent">What happened in Chattanooga gets to the heart of the idea of decentralization, the core of the original World Wide Web vision. Given the political paralysis in Washington, brought about by the power of money to control government, it is only right that productive experimentation is going to happen at the state and city levels. The Catholic Church has a concept called subsidiarity, which the <em class="calibre2">Oxford <a id="page-267"></a>English Dictionary</em> defines as “the idea that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed effectively at a more immediate or local level.” Yuval Levin, in his book <em class="calibre2">The Fractured Republic: Renewing America’s Social Contract in the Age of Individualism,</em> makes the case for subsidiarity.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Honing an inclination to subsidiarity would offer us a way of thinking about solving problems together that begins in the neighborhood, in the church, in the school, in the community and builds up. It would mean a political system and a government better suited to meeting Americans where they are, better adapted to the range and variety of problems our country now confronts, better positioned to help us try solutions that arise in places as close to the problems as possible—and then to use our modern networked architecture of decentralized communication to teach and learn from others dealing with similar problems—and better able to revitalize our civic culture.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">One of the fruits of this “think globally, act locally” strategy is found in the concept of the cooperative. A co-op is defined as a jointly owned enterprise engaging in the production or distribution of goods or the supplying of services, operated by its members for their mutual benefit. It seems to me that a co-op is the ideal way for producers of creative work to band together and get their content distributed at a fair price.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just consider the history of the most famous producer co-op in the United States, Sunkist Growers, Inc. Sunkist is a <a id="page-268"></a>marketing and distribution co-op for the four thousand growers of citrus fruit in California and Arizona. It is owned and managed by the growers themselves and had gross revenues of $1.1 billion in 2013. The co-op was formed in California in the 1890s to allow citrus growers to assert some collective power. Before the formation of the co-op, packinghouse owners, distributors, agents, and speculators—the middlemen—ruled, and the growers ranked a distant last in terms of exercising control over the industry. They were independent, small-scale farmers presiding over modest five-, ten-, and fifteen-acre groves without the organization and training to distribute their produce effectively. Their bargaining position got so bad that they were taking a loss on every crop, and the middlemen were earning high profits. In 1893 they formed the Southern California Fruit Growers Exchange. By regulating shipments and directing fruit where demand was the highest, the exchange made an immediate impact on the financial well-being of its growers. By the end of the first season growers realized an average net price of roughly $1 per box of oranges, a return far better than the twenty cents per box they had made the previous season. Within ten years the co-op had signed up about half of the growers in California. In 1908 the group registered the trademark “Sunkist” and later began stamping it on all its fruit, thus creating the first branded agricultural product. The co-op grew so strong that during the Depression, when prices plummeted, it was able to extend credit to its members so that very few of them had to sell their farms. When World War II arrived, the need for vitamin C–packed fruit juice to prevent scurvy led to many years of successful growth at Sunkist.</p>
<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-269"></a>I cite the case of Sunkist because many of today’s musicians and filmmakers are very much in the position of citrus growers in the 1890s. They are the key producers of their product, but they have no leverage and end up being an afterthought in the supply chain. The stunning thing about a zero-marginal-cost digital distribution system is that we forget that it could allow artists to run a nonprofit distribution cooperative and keep a far higher percentage of their revenues than they do now. YouTube takes 45 percent of the ad revenue on its site simply for running the infrastructure, without putting up production or marketing money. At worst the cost to run the infrastructure is around 5 percent, at current revenue levels, so the rest of the revenue is pure profit. What if artists ran a video and audio streaming site as a nonprofit cooperative (perhaps employing the technology in some of those free Google patents)? Let’s assume they would let the co-op keep 10 percent of the revenue, either from ads or subscriptions, in order to run the infrastructure and have money for general marketing. The artist would take the remaining 90 percent. Then, as Netflix does, the co-op could rent cloud service from Amazon, Microsoft, or IBM on a worldwide basis. I realize this system might have to start in the music business, where the cost of production is fairly low and most artists have access to the digital tools required to make their own music. But when you realize that more than one thousand independently financed feature films are made each year, without distribution commitments, there is clearly going to be a need for a film distribution co-op as well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Could the Sunkist model work in an artistic field? Well, it already has. Magnum Photos was formed by Robert <a id="page-270"></a>Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and ten other freelance photographers at the end of World War II. Magnum’s official history tells the story:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">It was founded as a co-operative in which the staff, including co-founders Maria Eisner and Rita Vandivert, would support rather than direct the photographers. Copyright would be held by the authors of the imagery, not by the magazines that published the work. This meant that a photographer could decide to cover a famine somewhere, publish the pictures in “Life” magazine, and the agency could then sell the photographs to magazines in other countries, such as Paris Match and Picture Post, giving the photographers the means to work on projects that particularly inspired them even without an assignment.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Seventy years later, Magnum is still thriving, allowing its artists to control their work and pursue their passions. This is a critical matter for creative people. Then there is Deca, which describes itself as “a global network of independent journalists, including Pulitzer, Polk, PEN, and National Magazine Award winners and finalists, who come together every year to bring a single, vital topic into sharp focus.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">In Brooklyn, a new filmmakers’ cooperative called SRSLY (short for “Seriously”), centered around female-identified filmmakers and feminist content, has begun making important work. Caroline Conrad, one of the founders, told <em class="calibre2">Brooklyn Magazine,</em> “One of our biggest motivations was to provide mentorship and guidance for <a id="page-271"></a>young female filmmakers. Unfortunately, support is extremely rare. Women in film are often driven to see one another as competitors rather than collaborators.” And in an article about the music collectives Odd Future and ASAP Mob, the <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> wrote, “The longstanding principles of individual success, taken for granted by an older generation, are moving out of fashion. With digitally enabled peer-to-peer everything, from riding to working to living, emerging artists and entrepreneurs are creating new paradigms for coexisting.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Like Magnum Photos, these cooperatives do not ask artists to forgo other distribution outlets but rather enable them to take advantage of a series of distribution windows that could lead to much higher income, even if it means less for the middlemen. This model exists in the music business in the form of Bandcamp. The <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> music critic Ben Ratliff explains:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">[Bandcamp] is known for its equitable treatment of artists, and [is] one of the greatest underground-culture bazaars of our time. From it, you can stream music to the extent each artist allows, or buy songs at a price set by the artist—which is sometimes “pay what you wish”—or order physical products from the site. The artist gets 85 percent. Always, the artist gets to know who’s buying, without a third party in the way. There’s also a social-media application on the site that lets the consumer know who else is buying and what else they’ve bought in the past. That is significant: You can triangulate your taste with other people, whom you don’t know, but whom you might come to trust.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-272"></a>We can imagine a future in which artists would release first to their fans through a site like Bandcamp, taking in 85 percent of the subscription revenue. The second release, three weeks later, would be to Apple Music and Spotify Premium, from which the artist would probably get 70 percent of the subscription revenue. The third release, four weeks after that, would be to ad-supported streaming services such as Spotify and YouTube, from which, as I have shown, the artist’s percentage would be much smaller. In this way, fans who want to hear the music immediately would pay more than casual fans who felt they could wait seven weeks for the record. Both Taylor Swift and Adele have used this windowing strategy with great success, but there is no reason most other artists couldn’t do the same—except that when some record labels held back on releasing their big hits on ad-supported streaming services, both Spotify and Google (which hosts the Spotify service and seems to have some say in its direction) have threatened them with going to the antitrust authorities.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This raises the question of what role a traditional record company would play in a co-op ecosystem. My sense is that we would end up with a kind of parallel universe in which traditional record companies are responsible for artist development and risk aggregation, but only for certain kinds of artists. Others, those in co-ops, would end up like the members of Magnum—capable of producing their own work. They would run their own social media promotion and book their own tours. Big-name artists might have no need for a record company, and many new indie artists might have no desire to be attached to one. But in the middle, there are probably a lot of artists who <a id="page-273"></a>would stay with traditional labels. In an ideal world, this kind of decentralized infrastructure of artist co-ops might bring back some of the regional distinctions that seemed so important when I was first on the road with Dylan and The Band. The music in San Antonio was then very different from the music in Austin. New Orleans was different from Memphis. Chicago R &amp; B didn’t sound anything like Detroit R &amp; B. The sound of Los Angeles was different from the sound of San Francisco. Though there are regional hip-hop styles, regionalism doesn’t exist today for most music. I hope it will return.</p>
