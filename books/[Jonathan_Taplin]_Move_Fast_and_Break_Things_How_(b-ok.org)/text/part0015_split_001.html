<p class="noindent">David Koch should have been celebrating. He had survived a plane crash and was convinced that God had saved him so that he in turn could save America. Here he was at the 2010 opening of his latest philanthropic project, the David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins at the Smithsonian Museum, which perfectly covered his business philosophy with the patina of public good. Koch is executive vice president of Koch Industries, a natural resources conglomerate with revenues of more than $100 billion per year. He and his brother Charles have a combined worth of more than $84 billion, gained almost entirely from the extraction business. From oil wells to vast logging operations, Koch Industries takes the earth’s natural resources at the cheapest price possible and <a id="page-192"></a>sells them at the highest price possible. The only thing that can get in the way of this gold rush is what economists call externalities—the costs that affect parties who did not choose to incur them, such as the cost of cleaning up the mess Koch Industries has made of the earth. So for their whole life in business, the Koch brothers have fought the government that seeks to get them to clean up their mess. They are our country’s richest and most committed libertarians and one of our country’s largest polluters. The reader may wonder what an exploration of the Koch brothers has to do with our larger story. The answer is externalities. Like the Kochs, Google and Facebook are in the extraction industry—their business model is to extract as much personal data from as many people in the world at the lowest possible price and to resell that data to as many companies as possible at the highest possible price—data is the new oil. And like Koch Industries, Google and Facebook create externalities during the extraction process. Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, outlined some of these externalities:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Edward Snowden showed we’ve inadvertently built the world’s largest surveillance network with the web. China can make it impossible for people there to read things, and just a few big service providers are the de facto organizers of your experience.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Others include YouTube’s decision to make available all the world’s music for free, which makes it impossible for many musicians to make a living. In addition, Google’s ability to promote its own services has turned competitive <a id="page-193"></a>services such as MapQuest into “zombies.” As Chico Harlan wrote in the <em class="calibre2">Washington Post,</em> “MapQuest is the rare American company that changed the world and then gradually became uncool, almost forgotten, in less than a generation.” But beyond the externalities comparison, the Kochs are important because they financed the rise of the libertarian political framework that Peter Thiel, Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg used to get rich. Without the political protection of the Koch network, none of the Internet empires would exist at its current scale.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But tonight at the Smithsonian opening, David isn’t happy, because he knows that a scrappy reporter for the <em class="calibre2">New Yorker,</em> Jane Mayer, is investigating his vast business and political empire. Even though he puts his name on many buildings, he is the least transparent billionaire you will ever meet. Within a month after Mayer’s first article is published, he will set a group of private investigators on her and do everything in his power to destroy her reputation—all to no avail.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And the David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins is just one more way to convince the world that the danger of climate change is a myth. The theme of the exhibit is that humans evolved over centuries of climate change, so we don’t have to worry about the fact that carbon dioxide levels are at their highest in history. But as the physicist Joseph Romm sees it, Koch is promoting a big lie. “The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue,” he said. “I think the Kochs wanted to be seen as some sort of high-minded company, associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country. But <a id="page-194"></a>the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are underground funders of action to stop efforts to deal with this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.” But the Kochs know that money talks, and, like many of the libertarians we have met so far, they are willing to spend heavily to influence both public opinion and the politicians who might regulate their business.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unlike many of the billionaires in our story, the Kochs are second-generation libertarians. Their father, Fred Koch, a chemical engineer with an MIT degree, invented an improvement to the process used for making gasoline from oil. This was in 1927, when the big US oil refiners were very happy with their business. Automobile purchases were exploding, new highways were being built, and Standard Oil and its brethren saw little reason to make new investments in their refineries. So Fred Koch took his business to the Soviet Union, where Joseph Stalin was more than ready to industrialize and catch up to the West. Then in 1934, he found a new customer, Adolf Hitler, who was building autobahns and quietly planning ways to supply the war machine he envisioned needing. As late as 1938, Koch was writing letters to his family from Germany, extolling Nazi efforts to instill discipline in their country and comparing Germany favorably to what he saw as the American welfare state. “When you contrast the state of mind of Germany today with what it was in 1925 you begin to think that perhaps this course of idleness, feeding at the public trough, dependence on government etc., with which we are afflicted is not permanent and can be <a id="page-195"></a>overcome,” he wrote. Like Ayn Rand, Fred Koch believed that the New Deal was the beginning of the end of American individualism. When the war started, Fred didn’t miss a step, creating a new high-octane fuel for US bombers that eventually destroyed the refinery he had built in Hamburg.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After the war, Fred developed a deep paranoia about the Soviet Union. He believed Stalin wanted to make America communist. In order to make others aware of this danger, he became one of the founding members of the John Birch Society, run by an ardent libertarian and anticommunist, Robert Welch Jr. Welch believed that both the US and Soviet governments were controlled by a cabal of internationalists, greedy bankers, and corrupt politicians. If left unexposed, the traitors inside the US government would betray the country’s sovereignty to the United Nations for a collectivist New World Order, managed by a “one-world socialist government.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">As his four sons grew up, Fred would school them on Birch Society literature with quizzes at the dinner table. David told an interviewer that his father “was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong with government and government policy. It’s something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that big government was bad, and impositions of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good.” Of the four, the two middle sons, Charles and David, drank the John Birch Kool-Aid, while the eldest, Freddie, gravitated toward drama school in college. The youngest, Bill, also showed little interest in his father’s political theories and ended up financing a yacht that won the America’s Cup. The family <a id="page-196"></a>dynamic, which had been forged by Fred’s regime of corporal punishment, got quite Shakespearean when Charles and David threatened to expose Freddie as a homosexual to their father unless he surrendered his shares in the company. Litigation between the two sets of brothers continued for years until Charles and David bought Freddie and Bill out of the company for $800 million. During the fight between the brothers, Bill commissioned Clayton Coppin, a George Mason University historian who had worked as a writer for Koch Industries, to write the story of Charles Koch. According to Jane Mayer, the book, entitled <em class="calibre2">Stealth: The History of Charles Koch’s Political Activities,</em> was never published, part of the settlement between the warring factions. Coppin writes that Charles was attracted to the most far-right—anarchist—factions of the libertarian movement: “He was driven by some deeper urge to smash the one thing left in the world that could discipline him: the government.” He is like a character in Ayn Rand’s <em class="calibre2">Atlas Shrugged</em>.</p>
