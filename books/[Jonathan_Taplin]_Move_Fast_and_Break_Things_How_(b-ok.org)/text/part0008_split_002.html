<p class="noindent">It is not an exaggeration to say that the work of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Larry Page, and Mark Zuckerberg stands on the shoulders of Doug Engelbart. Yet Engelbart’s vision of the computing future was different from today’s reality. In the run-up to the demonstration, Bill English had enlisted the help of <em class="calibre2">Whole Earth Catalog</em> publisher Stewart Brand, who had produced the Acid Tests with Ken <a id="page-52"></a>Kesey two years earlier. Engelbart felt that Brand might help make his show into a multimedia event. Kesey and Brand’s LSD festival had forever cemented San Francisco’s link to what Fred Turner in his book <em class="calibre2">From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism</em> describes as the New Communalists. Engelbart himself had taken acid twice under the supervision of a Stanford psychology PhD, Jim Fadiman, at the International Foundation for Advanced Study, the Bay Area research hub for academic LSD studies, which were legal until 1967. Geeks on acid, dreaming of the future. But financed by the military-industrial complex. Complicated.</p>
<p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre2">The Whole Earth Catalog,</em> subtitled <em class="calibre2">Access to Tools,</em> begins: “We are as gods, and we might as well get used to it.” Pretty bold mission statement. Was this a church? No, but the sense was that the New Communalist needed tools to create an individual identity free from the hidebound institutions of contemporary society, which was not an easy task. The introduction to the catalog continues, “A realm of intimate personal power is developing—power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment and share his adventure with whoever is interested.” Engelbart got this vision. NLS would provide a tool for individual empowerment: the user could access the world’s knowledge, create inspiring content, and share it with anyone. Less than two minutes into the San Francisco demo, Engelbart said, “If in your office you as an intellectual worker were supplied with a computer display backed up by a <a id="page-53"></a>computer that was alive for you all day and was instantly responsive to every action you have, how much value could you derive from that?” Engelbart had built a working prototype of what we today would easily recognize as a contemporary Internet device—fifteen years before the introduction of the Apple Macintosh.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The next year Engelbart took a team from the Stanford Research Institute to the Lama Foundation commune, north of Taos, New Mexico. It was Stewart Brand who suggested that Lama might provide an atmosphere, as John Markoff wrote, “to create a meeting of the minds between the NLS researchers and the counterculture community animated by the <em class="calibre2">Whole Earth Catalog</em>.” The land outside Taos was full of alternative communities—Morningstar East, Reality Construction Company, the Hog Farm, New Buffalo, and the Family, to name a few. Steve Durkee and Steve Baer, both disciples of Buckminster Fuller and close friends of Stewart Brand, ran Lama, and the architecture of the buildings hewed closely to Bucky Fuller’s geodesic dome design.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Fuller believed that what society needed was not more specialization but a new type of generalist, whom he called a comprehensive designer. For Bucky the problem of humanity’s survival was one of design, and he thought the “artist-scientist” could solve it:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">If man is to continue as a successful pattern-complex function in universal evolution, it will be because the next decades will have witnessed the artist-scientist’s seizure of the prime design responsibility and his successful <a id="page-54"></a>conversion of tool-augmented man from killingry to advanced livingry—adequate for all humanity.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">The irony, of course, was that Brand understood that most of the financing for Engelbart’s work was flowing from the fount of “killingry”—the government’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. DARPA was a direct response to the Soviet launch of <em class="calibre2">Sputnik 1</em> in 1957 and was set up to fund technology research projects that would expand the frontiers of expertise beyond the immediate and specific requirements of the military and its laboratories. It was an extremely flat organization, characterized as 100 scientists and a travel agent, that set out to give major university computer science labs the economic support to conduct basic research that would lead to US technological superiority in computers and networked connectivity. One of its first successful projects was the progenitor of the Internet—ARPANET, the world’s first packet switching network developed in 1962 between four university campuses.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Here is the paradox that libertarians just don’t get: the Internet was conceived and paid for by the US government. It was not a product of the free market as we think of it today—the realization of some young entrepreneur’s dreams. It was painstakingly researched and executed by a bunch of academics for whom IPO billions weren’t a reason to work. Rather, these people were fundamentally convinced that they could make the world a better place with their inventions. Every piece of code—HTML, <a id="page-55"></a>TCP/IP—was donated to the ARPANET project royalty-free. Of course DARPA had its own reasons for funding Doug Engelbart’s research, deeply interwoven with Cold War paranoia and post–nuclear attack “survivability,” but that was irrelevant to the purpose and the idealism of Engelbart, Brand, Vint Cerf, Tim Berners-Lee, and a host of other geniuses who made the Internet. But ultimately the connection with the military led to the undoing of Engelbart’s NLS vision.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By 1969 the antiwar demonstrations outside the SRI building were a daily occurrence. Inside, the research team, which was growing quickly—thanks to increasing DARPA investment after the successful San Francisco demo—began to break into two factions: computer geeks and countercultural humanists. Engelbart had a hard time holding these groups together. The hippies would go off on retreats and not invite the committed DARPA scientists. In 1970 Xerox hired one of the leaders of DARPA, Bob Taylor, to form a new lab called the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Taylor’s first move was to poach Bill English, the chief NLS engineer. Within months they had built a team, among whom was computer scientist Alan Kay, that would create a commercial version of Engelbart’s vision.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What is so important about Engelbart’s legacy is that he saw the computer as primarily a tool to augment—not replace—human capability. In our current era, by contrast, much of the financing flowing out of Silicon Valley is aimed at building machines that can replace humans. In a famous encounter in 1953 at MIT, Marvin Minsky, the <a id="page-56"></a>father of research on artificial intelligence, declared: “We’re going to make machines intelligent. We are going to make them conscious!” To which Doug Engelbart replied: “You’re going to do all that for the machines? What are you going to do for the people?”</p>
