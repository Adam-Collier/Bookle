<p class="noindent">Before I continue with Zuckerberg’s story, I want to pause to ponder just why his invention created such a profound shift in the world of communication. Facebook is changing the norms of what it means to be private, what it means to be a kid, and what it means to be a “human product.” As the phrase goes, if you are not paying for it, you are not the customer, you are the product. Perhaps Mark Zuckerberg’s greatest insight was that the human desire to be “liked” was so strong that Facebook’s users would create all the content on the site for free. In 2014, Facebook’s 1.23 billion regular users logged in to the site for seventeen minutes each day—as the <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> pointed out. In total, that’s more than <em class="calibre2">39,757 years</em> of time collectively spent on Facebook in a single day. That’s almost fifteen million years of free labor per year. Karl Marx would have been totally mystified.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The first question that needs to be asked is why we are <a id="page-151"></a>so willing to surrender our labor and our personal data for free to an immensely profitable monopoly. To understand that, researchers at the University of Connecticut, led by Daniel Hunt, tried to understand why people spend so much time on Facebook. The blog <em class="calibre2">ReadWrite</em> summarized the study like so:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Researchers have long known that five broad categories drive online activity: information seeking, interpersonal communication, self-expression, passing time and entertainment. In the study led by Hunt, the goal was to see if the same measures drove people to spend time on Facebook. The study confirmed that, with the exception of information seeking, all of the other behavioral factors that drive online activity hold true for Facebook, with entertainment and time passing being two of the biggest drivers of Facebook activity.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">What their research really found was that although we may originally sign up for Facebook for interpersonal communication, fairly quickly we use it to fight boredom. But fighting boredom could not be the only reason, because young adults have many entertainment options. What distinguishes Facebook and other social networks is their role in self-expression—the need to present oneself to one’s peers in a positive light. In 1987, the psychologists Hazel Markus and Paula Nurius suggested that a person has two selves: the “now self” and the “possible self.” What Facebook allows is the presentation of the “hoped-for possible <a id="page-152"></a>self” in the form of the best-looking selfies, the coolest party pictures, and other presentations of an ideal life that may or may not exist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But the presentation of self may not always be voluntary. In her book <em class="calibre2">Dragnet Nation: A Quest for Privacy, Security, and Freedom in a World of Relentless Surveillance,</em> Julia Angwin presents the story of Bobbi Duncan:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Bobbi Duncan, a twenty-two-year-old lesbian student at the University of Texas, Austin, tried to keep her sexual orientation secret from her family. But Facebook inadvertently outed her when the president of the Queer Chorus on campus added her to the choir’s Facebook group. Bobbi didn’t know that a friend could add her to a group without her approval and that Facebook would then send a note to her entire list of friends—including her father—announcing that she had joined.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Her father’s note on his Facebook page—“Hell awaits you pervert, good luck singing there”—makes it clear why Bobbi wanted to keep her sexual orientation to herself. Part of the reason she was unable to do so is because Zuckerberg and his Facebook team had embraced the notion of “radical transparency”—the idea that openness is the chief goal of the service and thus you can only use your real name. But many people, including Bobbi Duncan, disagree. Zuckerberg told Kirkpatrick, “To get to this point where there is more openness—that’s a big challenge, but I think we will do it. The concept that the world will be <a id="page-153"></a>better if you share more is something that is pretty foreign to a lot of people and it runs into all these privacy concerns.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">The disdain for “these privacy concerns” first surfaced when in 2007 Facebook deployed an application called Beacon. This was essentially an alert system that told your friends you had purchased something on a partner site. It was built as an opt-out system, so you actively had to tell Facebook each time you didn’t want the site to broadcast your purchase to all your friends. It was a total disaster from the outset, but Zuckerberg was so confident that he knew better than his users that he refused to turn it off for many weeks while the PR disaster escalated. Eventually he relented and posted a mea culpa on his blog, saying, “We’ve made a lot of mistakes building this feature, but we’ve made even more with how we’ve handled them.” Despite Zuckerberg’s regret and a payment of $9.5 million in a class-action suit over Beacon, many who worked with him feel he doesn’t really understand privacy. Charlie Cheever, one of his key programmers, told Kirkpatrick, “I feel that Mark doesn’t believe in privacy that much, or at least believes in privacy as a stepping-stone [to radical transparency].”</p>
<p class="calibre5">The privacy issue was reignited in early 2014, when the <em class="calibre2">Wall Street Journal</em> reported that Facebook had conducted a massive social-science experiment on nearly seven hundred thousand of its users.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">To determine whether it could alter the emotional state of its users and prompt them to post either more positive or <a id="page-154"></a>negative content, the site’s data scientists enabled an algorithm, for one week, to automatically omit content that contained words associated with either positive or negative emotions from the central news feeds of 689,003 users.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">As it turned out, the experiment was very “successful” in that it was relatively easy to manipulate users’ emotions, but the backlash from the blogosphere was horrendous. “Apparently what many of us feared is already a reality: Facebook is using us as lab rats, and not just to figure out which ads we’ll respond to but to actually change our emotions,” wrote Sophie Weiner on AnimalNewYork.com.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In May of 2016, Facebook board member Peter Thiel was drawn into the privacy debate when it was revealed that he had financed a lawsuit brought by Hulk Hogan against the online news site <em class="calibre2">Gawker,</em> which he accused of violating his privacy when it put a sex tape online. Thiel’s stated reason was to destroy <em class="calibre2">Gawker,</em> one of whose publications, <em class="calibre2">Valleywag,</em> had outed Thiel in 2007. After that incident Thiel had stated, “<em class="calibre2">Valleywag</em> is the Silicon Valley equivalent of al-Qaida.” Nine years later he got his revenge, telling the <em class="calibre2">New York Times,</em> “I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest.” The revelation quickly exposed the battle lines between Silicon Valley and the media. Mark Zuckerberg had publicly stated that privacy norms were evolving and his board member Thiel had backed him up. But with <em class="calibre2">Gawker,</em> Thiel was reasserting his right to privacy, even though it was general knowledge in Silicon <a id="page-155"></a>Valley that he was gay. The irony was that Owen Thomas, the gay writer who wrote the <em class="calibre2">Valleywag</em> piece, ended with this statement: “That’s why I think it’s important to say this: Peter Thiel, the smartest VC in the world, is gay. More power to him.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">After Thiel confessed to secretly funding the <em class="calibre2">Gawker</em> lawsuit, Marc Andreessen, Thiel’s fellow Facebook board member, came to his defense, writing on Twitter, “Greenpeace and Sierra Club, among many other progressive groups, routinely fund other plaintiffs’ lawsuits.” But Andreessen neglected to mention that they do so openly, not in secret. Another VC, Vinod Khosla, tweeted support, remarking, “The press gets very uppity when challenged.” But it was the far-right supporters of Donald Trump (Thiel was a Trump delegate) who came to Thiel’s support in great numbers on Twitter, using the hashtag #ThankYouPeter. Trump’s principal Breitbart News Network backer, Milo Yiannopoulos, wrote, “Freedom-minded PayPal founder Peter Thiel has revealed himself to be a Batman of sorts. The hero Silicon Valley needed.” But Jason Mandell, a PR specialist based in Silicon Valley, highlighted the basic contradiction between libertarian beliefs and freedom of the press. “People like Peter Thiel are used to being able to tell an engineer ‘this is broken—fix it’,” Mandell said. “They don’t understand the unique dynamic between the press and the public. They don’t understand the first amendment and free speech as it relates to the media.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course the very fact that Thiel’s candidate Donald Trump has threatened to remove libel protection for media <a id="page-156"></a>organizations should give one pause. In February of 2016, at a rally Trump said, “One of the things I’m going to do if I win… I’m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money.” Nicholas Lemann, writing in the <em class="calibre2">New Yorker</em> in May of 2016, understood how high the stakes were: “Remember that Thiel is a graduate of Stanford Law School who clerked for a year on the Eleventh Circuit, and that, in his world, ‘scale’ and ‘disruption’ are the hoped-for ends of every investment. He is surely aware of this case’s potential to begin a reexamination of the fundamental questions in American press law, far beyond the fate of Gawker.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">The current narrative we seem to tell ourselves about our privacy is that it is a sort of currency we trade to corporations in return for innovation. But the corporation has an insatiable appetite for our most personal data in order to drive us to consume during our every waking moment. I think this is critical, because in some ways social networks are powerful engines of conformity. The ability for students to develop their own ideas, identities, and political affiliations should take place outside of the panopticon view of Facebook, but whether this is any longer possible is an open question. My own memory is that the development of my political and cultural persona between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one had a lot to do with being outside the zone of judgment of my parents, their conservative peers from my hometown, Cleveland, and maybe even from my siblings. I’m not sure that it could happen if we were all on Facebook together.</p>
