<p class="noindent">Now, it very well may be that privacy is a hopelessly outdated notion and that Mark Zuckerberg’s belief that privacy is no longer a social norm has won the day. But it is one thing to forfeit our privacy as individuals to a company that we believe is delivering a needed service and another to open our personal lives to the federal government.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Has Zuckerberg’s belief in the end of privacy influenced his relations with government surveillance? In June of 2013, Glenn Greenwald, writing in the <em class="calibre2">Guardian,</em> revealed that in 2009, Facebook, along with Google and Apple (and four other online service providers), had given the National Security Agency direct access to their worldwide network for the agency’s PRISM spying program. Below is a slide from an NSA internal presentation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Writing in the British publication <em class="calibre2">Computer Weekly,</em> Kevin Cahill noted, “The possibility of universal mass surveillance became clear to the NSA in the early part of this century, as the reach of the nine largest US Internet providers grew to more than 50% of all Internet users on the planet. The Internet giants were developing a reach that the spooks in Fort Meade, the NSA’s HQ in Maryland, could only dream of. So the spooks stepped in and more than nine corporations obliged by delivering their clients’ data. It was, and is, the largest hack in human history—so far.”</p>

<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-158"></a>Where does surveillance marketing stop and spying begin? When Greenwald’s article, based on the revelations of Edward Snowden, came out, Zuckerberg responded that the government had done a “bad job” of protecting people’s privacy. “Frankly I think the government blew it,” he said. But just how hard did he fight to protect the data of his users? And had Facebook, in its commercial hoovering of consumer data, done an equally bad job of protecting its users’ privacy? This also seems to be why Apple didn’t receive more vocal support from Facebook and Google in February of 2016, when it chose to resist the FBI’s request that it build a trapdoor into the encryption of the iPhone 6. As one wag posted on Twitter, “Why haven’t Ooogle, 2Facedbook and Microsuck got [Apple CEO] Cook’s back? Their biz model: spying &amp; selling data! Appl sells phones!”</p>
