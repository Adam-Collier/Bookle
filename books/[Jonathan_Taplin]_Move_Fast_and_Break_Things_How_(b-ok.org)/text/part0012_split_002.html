<p class="noindent">But it is in the area of “regulatory capture” that Google has really excelled. Regulatory capture, according to Nobel laureate George Stigler, is the process by which regulatory agencies eventually come to be dominated by the very industries they were charged with regulating. Putting aside the fact that Google chairman Eric Schmidt has visited the Obama White House more than any other corporate executive in America and that Google chief lobbyist Katherine <a id="page-129"></a>Oyama was associate counsel to Vice President Joe Biden, the list of highly placed Googlers in the federal government is truly mind-boggling.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bl-list">• The US chief technology officer and one of her deputies are former Google employees.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• The acting assistant attorney general in the Justice Department’s antitrust division is a former antitrust attorney at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, the Silicon Valley firm that represented Google.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• The White House’s chief digital officer is a former Google employee.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• One of the top assistants to the chairman of the FCC is a former Google employee and another ran a public lobbying firm funded in part by Google.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• The director of United States Digital Service, responsible for fixing and maintaining Healthcare.gov, is a former Google employee.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• The director of the US Patent and Trademark Office is the former head of patents at Google.</p></div>
<p class="calibre5">And of course the revolving door goes both in and out of the government, as the Google Transparency Project (an independent watchdog report) clearly stated.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bl-list">• There have been fifty-three revolving-door moves between Google and the White House.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Those moves involved twenty-two former White House officials who left the administration to work <a id="page-130"></a>for Google and thirty-one Google executives (or executives from Google’s main outside firms) who joined the White House or were appointed to federal advisory boards.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• There have been twenty-eight revolving-door moves between Google and government that involve national security, intelligence, or the Department of Defense. Seven former national security and intelligence officials and eighteen Pentagon officials moved to Google, while three Google executives moved to the Defense Department.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• There have been twenty-three revolving-door moves between Google and the State Department during the Obama administration. Eighteen former State Department officials joined Google, while five Google officials took up senior posts at the State Department.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• There have been nine moves between either Google or its outside lobbying firms and the Federal Communications Commission, which handles a growing number of regulatory matters that have a major impact on the company’s bottom line.</p></div>
<p class="calibre5">Here one can sense that Google has a type of insurance policy: at key agencies such as the FCC, the Office of Management and Budget, the patent office, and the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Google will always have a seat at the table and be able to access critical intelligence if its interests are threatened. And Google is casting its net beyond the Obama administration, according to an <a id="page-131"></a>investigative report in <em class="calibre2">Quartz</em> that looked into Eric Schmidt’s firm the Groundwork.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">The Groundwork, according to Democratic campaign operatives and technologists, is part of efforts by Schmidt—the executive chairman of Google parent-company Alphabet—to ensure that [Hillary] Clinton has the engineering talent needed to win the election. And it is one of a series of quiet investments by Schmidt that recognize how modern political campaigns are run, with data analytics and digital outreach as vital ingredients that allow candidates to find, court, and turn out critical voter blocs.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Google makes sure to place bets on both sides of the aisle. So while Eric Schmidt is advising Hillary Clinton’s campaign, Larry Page flew with Sean Parker and Elon Musk in March of 2016 to a secret Republican meeting at a resort in Sea Island, Georgia, organized by the right-wing think tank the American Enterprise Institute. There they met with Republican leadership, including Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan as well as Karl Rove, to plan Republican 2016 election strategy. My own experience in talking to legislators about Internet reform has led me to understand that Google, Amazon, and Facebook are deeply embedded in both parties, and their interests will be protected no matter who is in the White House.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But occasionally even these insurance policies are not enough to head off trouble. Since 2014, two examples of the way Google applies its political muscle have played out <a id="page-132"></a>in public. The first was at the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that is supposed to regulate Google’s advertising and search business. On March 24, 2015, the <em class="calibre2">Wall Street Journal</em> revealed the existence of a leaked report from the competition bureau of the FTC recommending that Google be prosecuted for abusing its market position by recommending Google services over those of third parties. What was astonishing was that the full commission had, in a very unusual manner, overruled the staff recommendation and decided against prosecuting Google. The <em class="calibre2">Journal</em> alleged that the 230 meetings that Google had had at the White House in the run-up to the complaint dismissal had influenced the commission. This caused the FTC to issue a classic denial.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Today’s Wall Street Journal article “Google Makes Most of Close Ties to White House” makes a number of misleading inferences and suggestions about the integrity of the FTC’s investigation. The article suggests that a series of disparate and unrelated meetings involving FTC officials and executive branch officials or Google representatives somehow affected the Commission’s decision to close the search investigation in early 2013.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">But as most everyone—including the numerous travel services that competed against Google—knew, the FTC staff was right. As Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman testified before the Senate antitrust subcommittee, “Google first began taking our content without permission a year ago. Despite public and private protests, Google gave the <a id="page-133"></a>ultimatum that only a monopolist can give: In order to appear in web search you must allow us to use your content to compete against you.” So Google did advantage its own services, and as it pushed into more markets, the problem would only increase. The final irony is that the FTC’s decision not to prosecute Google was influenced heavily by a paper that Google paid Robert Bork (shortly before he died) and Gregory Sidak to write for them. Bork and Sidak’s argument said: “[The fact] that consumers can switch to substitute search engines instantaneously and at zero cost constrains Google’s ability and incentive to act anti-competitively.” But as many researchers have pointed out, my use of multiple Google services (Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Calendar) essentially ties me to Google and makes the cost of switching far more cumbersome in terms of time and effort than Bork suggests.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A more blatant display of Google’s power took place after Mississippi attorney general Jim Hood subpoenaed Google in October of 2014 in an effort to determine whether Google was in compliance with the Justice Department settlement the company had entered into in 2011—i.e., whether it was still knowingly profiting from illegal trade. Google had paid a fine of $500 million, which covered the amount that it had profited from the advertising for illegal pharmacies on its search service, plus the amount that the Canadian pharmacies had received from US customers buying illegal drugs. All the oxycodone that was available online through a Google search a few years earlier had been stopped. So General Hood asked for, among other things, the search logs to determine whether Google was <a id="page-134"></a>sending its customers to other illegal sites, including those selling pirated movies, music, and games.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Google, citing the DMCA, said it was protected under federal law and the First Amendment and that the subpoena was an attempt to coerce them into blocking sites that infringe on copyright. “The Attorney General may prefer a pre-filtered Internet,” the lawsuit read, “but the Constitution and Congress have denied him the authority to mandate it.” Hood quickly retreated but made it clear that Google was trying to use its money and power “to stop the State of Mississippi for daring to ask some questions.” Nevertheless, he said he would call the company and try to work out a deal. Needless to say, when he called, Google didn’t answer. There was no deal to be worked out, and after going back and forth in the court of appeals, both the subpoena and the lawsuit were dropped for good in 2016. As former labor secretary Robert Reich told me, “My sense is that political power trumps any ideology such as consumer welfare economics, but a powerful ideology can help sell the position advocated by a powerful political player. The irony here, of course, is that Google’s entrenched position has given it enormous political power—which is one of the arguments against allowing any company to become so large and entrenched.”</p>
