<p class="hanging">My calculation on the $50 billion a year reallocation of revenue from content creators to tech platforms goes as follows: According to the Newspaper Association of America, newspaper ad revenues have fallen from $65.8 billion in 2000 to $23.6 billion in 2014. So that’s a $42.2 billion shortfall. According to the Record Industry Association of America, recorded music revenues have fallen from $19.8 billion in 2000 to $7.2 billion in 2014. So that is another $12.6 billion shortfall. According to the Digital Entertainment Group, video home-entertainment revenues were $24.2 billion in 2006 and $18 billion in 2014. So that is another $6 billion per year shortfall. In total, that is $61 billion a year less to content creators and that doesn’t even count the book business, whose revenues have remained essentially flat because the juvenile business has almost made up for the 23 percent decline since 2007 in nonfiction sales, and the 37 percent decline in adult fiction sales. These statistics come from Nielsen Bookscan and include ebook sales.</p>
