<p class="noindent">I have said that Mark Zuckerberg is the most complicated character in this story, filled with contradictions. Giving <a id="page-170"></a>most of his wealth away, contrary to the example set by Page and Thiel, is a start. In an open letter to his daughter in which he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced that they were giving 99 percent of their Facebook shares away, he wrote, “Technology can’t solve problems by itself. Building a better world starts with building strong and healthy communities.” This would suggest that Zuckerberg and his wife are not techno-determinists, as Page and Thiel are, and that they are making a commitment to democracy and all the messiness it implies. Democracy thrives because of competing voices in politics as well as in the media. If Facebook becomes my primary source of news, with the ability to filter what I see, then the civic square will no longer exist. If I “unfriend” Fox News and conservative commentator David Brooks in order for my worldview to be continually affirmed, then a principal aspect of our democracy—the need to remain informed—will die. The 2016 presidential campaign brought Facebook’s political power into focus. The <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> columnist Farhad Manjoo wrote, “Among techies, there is now widespread concern that Facebook and Twitter have hastened the decline of journalism and the irrelevance of facts. Social networks seem also to have contributed to a rise in the kind of trolling, racism, and misogyny that characterized so much of Mr. Trump’s campaign.” The critical combination of a Facebook page and a Google AdSense account has allowed purveyors of fake news from Montana to Macedonia to make money off their fake news posts. But Mark Zuckerberg refuses to even acknowledge how powerful Facebook is as a media filter, asserting that it would “be crazy” to believe Facebook had <a id="page-171"></a>any effect on the election outcome. He quickly walked that back when faced with evidence to the contrary, but said, “We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves.” This notion that it is hard to discern the truth of whether the pope endorsed Donald Trump or whether Hillary Clinton had John Kennedy Jr. killed seems to me a cop-out. If Zuckerberg really wants to build “strong and healthy communities,” he must face this issue soon.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To do that will be to shake off the influence of the libertarians, many of whom are his mentors and seem to have very different priorities from his own, as he must have realized after news got out about Sean Parker’s wedding in the summer of 2013. Parker had spent $10 million to build a <em class="calibre2">Lord of the Rings</em>–themed fantasy set for his nuptials in the middle of the forest without bothering to obtain a single permit. As <em class="calibre2">The Atlantic</em> commented, “Nothing says, ‘I love the Earth!’ quite like bringing bulldozers into an old-growth forest to create a fake ruined castle.” As Parker himself complained, press reports of his wedding ceremony unleashed “a mob of Internet trolls, eco-zealots, and other angry folk from every corner of the Internet,” resulting in “a fury of vulgar insults, flooding our email and Facebook pages.” He later paid a $2.2 million fine to the California Coastal Commission, but the irony of his being roasted on Facebook was almost too much. “As if by some process of karmic retribution,” he wrote, “the mediums I dedicated my life to building have all too often become the very weapon by which my own character and reputation has been mercilessly attacked in public.”</p>
