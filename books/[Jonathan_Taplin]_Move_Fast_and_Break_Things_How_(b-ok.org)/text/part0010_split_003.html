<p class="noindent">The German novelist Thomas Mann would have described Sean Parker as a bourgeois manqué, a man of passing artistic desire who is nevertheless chained to a world of suits and bureaucratic concerns. That would also describe Larry Page, founder and CEO of Google, a young man who played the saxophone in high school and studied music composition. Page tried to invent a music synthesizer while at the University of Michigan, but was unable to create the real-time software that the device needed. Like Parker (and perhaps his fellow music lover Steve Jobs), Page didn’t have the talent to make it as a professional musician, so he applied for the master’s program in computer science at Stanford University and enrolled in the PhD program there in 1995.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The most important element Page seems to have derived from his music education is the importance of speed. “In some sense I feel like music training led to the high-speed legacy of Google for me,” Page said during an interview with <em class="calibre2">Fortune</em>. “In music you’re very cognizant of time. Time is like the primary thing.” Larry Page probably never listened to early Louis Armstrong records, in which the notion of time is reinvented. Armstrong threw away the classical meanings of time, which he had learned in the marching bands of New Orleans, and replaced it with a slippery <a id="page-96"></a>push-pull syncopation that would come to define the idea of swing. Perhaps we can get a small insight from this into the culture clash between the nerds and the artists. The time clock in a computer is unforgiving, but a great musician often plays behind the beat. Once computers became ubiquitous in music, then the computer clock (e.g., disco’s 120 beats per minute) brought Page’s idea of time into popular music.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Like Sean Parker, Page liked Burning Man, saying, “[It’s] an environment where people can try new things. I think as technologists we should have some safe places where we can try out new things and figure out the effect on society. What’s the effect on people, without having to deploy it to the whole world?” In fact, Page and his partner Sergey Brin were so entranced with Burning Man that they cited Eric Schmidt’s attendance there as one of the major reasons they agreed to hire him as CEO after the Google board decided that Page and Brin needed “adult supervision.” I suppose Parker and Page both embrace Burning Man because for a long weekend it approximates the “free cities” model they embrace—in which polities are privately owned and unregulated by states—an ideal way for capitalists to avoid the “mob mentality” of democracy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This need for control also played itself out when Google went public. Brin and Page set up a two-class stock structure (mimicking monopoly cable firms such as Comcast) in which their own shares had ten times the voting power of the shares offered to the public. As Page explained in his first letter to shareholders, “New investors will fully share in Google’s long term economic future but will have little <a id="page-97"></a>ability to influence its strategic decisions through their voting rights.” Page and Brin set out to deliberately “disrupt” the classic idea of a public corporation. The very idea of shareholder democracy was anathema to them. They wanted all the advantages of the public’s investment capital but none of the disadvantages of having to answer to shareholders.</p>
