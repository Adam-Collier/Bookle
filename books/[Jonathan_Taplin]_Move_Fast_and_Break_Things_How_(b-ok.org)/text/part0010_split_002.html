<p class="noindent">For Sean Parker there was no downside to being a convicted corporate hacker if it also meant that he could be the inventor of the first technology to steal intellectual property. In the movie about Facebook, <em class="calibre2">The Social Network,</em> Parker is played by Justin Timberlake. Sean’s bad-boy persona, captured perfectly by Timberlake, appealed to a young Mark Zuckerberg, who eventually appointed Sean president of Facebook. Parker served an important function, introducing Zuckerberg to Peter Thiel, who became the company’s first outside investor. But Parker couldn’t shake his bad-boy habits, and in 2005 he was busted on suspicion of cocaine possession on a kiteboarding trip in North Carolina during a late-night raid on a house he was renting. Once again Parker managed to avoid prosecution, but he agreed to leave Facebook. Thiel, of course, stayed loyal to his friend, hiring him at his Founders Fund venture capital firm and noting, “Sean is one of the great serial entrepreneurs of his generation, someone who is really changing the world and turning the wheel of history.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thiel’s Randian ethical framework makes it easy to cast Parker as someone who’s “turning the wheels of history” despite the morally challenged projects his fame is built upon. The notion that Parker is a great disrupter cannot be disputed, but the fact that his businesses were built on copyright theft (Napster) and deep consumer surveillance (Facebook) leads us to question what exactly these attention harvesting industries create and whether they’re aiding the larger culture or destroying it. Disruption of <a id="page-93"></a>critical cultural infrastructure is only worthy if the replacement is more beneficial to the society at large than the original institution was. For instance, has the wholesale destruction of the newspaper industry (see chart below) been followed by the establishment of a more reliable source of local and global news? Or has it just resulted in noise and confusion? Thiel and Parker’s Facebook currently provides 70 percent of the inbound traffic for <em class="calibre2">BuzzFeed</em> and the <em class="calibre2">Huffington Post</em>. These three sites are now the sole sources of news for many of their online users. How long before Facebook becomes the controlling force in the online journalism business?</p>

<p class="calibre5">The disrupters of Silicon Valley have a very high opinion of their place in history and the role of technology in forcing change and evolving the economy. As Parker puts it, “It’s technology, not business or government, that’s the <a id="page-94"></a>real driving force behind large-scale societal shifts.” But as the atomic scientist Robert Oppenheimer discovered after Hiroshima, technological progress has no inherent moral arc. Parker himself explains this best in an interview with the journalist David Kirkpatrick:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">I think the best way to describe me is as an archetypal Loki character, like Joseph Campbell’s Hero with a Thousand Faces. I’m like the prankster or Puck in mythology. He’s not trying to cause harm, but rather to pull back the veil that masks your conventional, collectively reinforced understanding of society. This renegade thing was very clear at Napster. The point was that the emperor—the content industry—had no clothes. This all probably sounds incredibly pretentious and narcissistic.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">In the same interview Parker bemoaned contemporary culture’s scarcity of revolutionary thinkers like Jim Morrison or Jack Kerouac. It is a bit rich to hear the rebel venture capitalist who travels every year to the Burning Man festival in the hope of recapturing his Jim Morrison dream bemoan the tired thinking of his fellow Americans—despite the wholesale wreckage his adventures have wrought on American culture, including the very music business Morrison depended upon. For the uninitiated, Burning Man is an annual gathering that takes place in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada over Labor Day weekend. It has been described as “an experiment in community and art” influenced by ten main principles, including “radical inclusion, self-reliance, and self-expression.” This libertarian Woodstock involves a <a id="page-95"></a>lot of drug taking, naked dancing, and general madness—the perfect place for Parker, born years after the original music festival, to play out his rock-rebel fantasies.</p>
