<p class="noindent">Summarizing an Interactive Advertising Bureau report, <em class="calibre2">Advertising Age</em> noted, “Pirated content takes an estimated $2 billion from the movie, music, and TV industries and eliminating piracy would generate an additional $456 million in annual advertising revenue around legitimate content.” Beyond the damage piracy does to the advertising and content industries, however, the individual musicians and filmmakers whose work was the attraction for both members and advertisers received nothing from Megaupload. In 2013, the UK rights-management organization PRS for Music and Google published a joint report entitled “The Six Business Models of Copyright Infringement.” It revealed that advertising supported 86 percent of the peer-to-peer search sites that feature illegally distributed content. This finding clearly <a id="page-178"></a>indicates that many major brands are not aware that they are, in fact, the key source of funds for the piracy industry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In 2013, the USC Annenberg Innovation Lab set out to understand how all that advertising wound up on sites like Megaupload. We found that Google’s Ad Exchange, along with Yahoo and total bandits such as Propeller Ads and SumoTorrent, were the main sources. But of course it was big brands such as Ford, Citibank, Nationwide, and many others that fed the pirates with millions of dollars. We noted that the ads seemed aimed at young males—those who were buying a first car, getting car insurance for the first time, choosing a bank. When the report came out, Google was angry that it had been named as the worst offender among the ad networks. The company sent us a letter, which read, in part:</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">In addition to sites that participate in our network, millions of advertisers and publishers use our DoubleClick technology to manage their digital advertising, not just on our network but across the whole web. Advertisers and publishers ultimately decide how to use this technology and we cannot “see” where all these ads appear (nor do we have a revenue share). However, when we do become aware of DoubleClick technology powering ads on copyright-violating sites, we contact the affected advertisers and publishers to take action.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This was of course the same excuse that Kim Dotcom had used when he said in an interview, “It’s not my job to police what people are uploading. It’s the job of the content owners, and the law is very clear. If you create content, and you want to protect your copyrights, you have to do the <a id="page-179"></a>work.” This of course is a reference to the “safe harbor” provision of the DMCA that YouTube has used as a shield so effectively (see <a href="part0010_split_004.html#page-100">here</a>). Of course a key part of the provision is that the service provider should not willingly be hosting stolen content. Kim was never able to use that defense. But Google not only enabled Kim’s advertising business, it was also the way browsers found Megaupload. Try a little experiment. Go on your Google search engine and type “watch [insert the name of your favorite movie here] free online.” What will come up are direct links to all the major pirate sites. As Google itself has suggested, if you can’t find something on Google, it doesn’t exist. So Google could easily solve the problem of pirated entertainment by doing the same thing it did after it paid a $500 million fine for linking to illegal drug vendor sites. It simply “disappeared” them. And then those sites went out of business.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To go a step deeper is to probe the Internet’s role in the “fake economy.” The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) expects the value of counterfeit goods globally to exceed $1.7 trillion in 2015. That’s more than 2 percent of the world’s total economic output. In June of 2016, the chairman of the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, Jack Ma, was challenged by analysts on an earnings call to explain why such a high percentage of Alibaba’s revenue came from counterfeit goods. Much to the shock of the analysts, Ma replied, “The fake products today are of better quality and better price than the real names.” But the problem is not just fake Chanel purses. Amazon’s Marketplace is also flooded with Chinese knockoffs of famous brands. In a letter written in July of 2016, the CEO of Birkenstock, <a id="page-180"></a>David Kahan, instructed Amazon to stop selling Birkenstock’s famous sandals. “The Amazon marketplace, which operates as an ‘open market,’ creates an environment where we experience unacceptable business practices which we believe jeopardize our brand,” Kahan wrote. “Policing this activity internally and in partnership with Amazon.com has proven impossible.” The famous Los Angeles painter Ed Ruscha has a part-time staffer just to send takedown notices to sites, such as eBay, that are selling forgeries of his work. Universal Music Group has twenty people working full-time on this problem. Of course the work of policing pirate websites may be one of those new job opportunities for hackers that Marc Andreessen promises are coming.</p>
