<p class="noindent">Robert Bork did more than any individual in the twentieth century to embed the libertarian free-market principles of Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman into the heart of the American economic and judicial system. Professor Bork’s class on antitrust law at Yale Law School was usually packed. In 1971, he had taught Bill Clinton and his soon-to-be wife, Hillary, as well as Robert Reich, Clarence Thomas, and Richard Blumenthal. Bork was tall, with very curly brown hair, big tortoiseshell glasses, and a beard that made him look like a cross between an Amish farmer and a rabbi. He was partial to dark suits and Brooks <a id="page-110"></a>Brothers button-down shirts, and his one concession to fashion was his tendency to favor paisley ties.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The theory of antitrust Bork taught (wags called it a course in pro-trust law) came out of his original thinking on the nature of business regulation. Reich recalls Bork’s class as being quite contentious: “I didn’t know how much his ideas would influence antitrust policy in future years. At the time they seemed absurd to me because they looked at only one dimension of public policy—consumer welfare—and disregarded all of the dynamic effects of concentration, such as political power or predation.” In March of 1973, Bork would put his classroom concepts to work as solicitor general of the United States during the Richard Nixon and, later, the Gerald Ford administrations. One measure of how little Bork thought of the Sherman Act (our main antitrust statute) is that its filings dropped substantially during Bork’s term. When Bork left the Justice Department he published <em class="calibre2">The Antitrust Paradox: A Policy at War with Itself,</em> which has shaped antitrust law ever since, mostly by focusing the discipline on efficiency and articulating its goal as “consumer welfare.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">In other words, Bork argued that the sole matter that should concern regulators was whether prices to consumers were falling. From Bork’s point of view, if Walmart ended up as the only general retailer in the country, as long as prices continued to fall, this would benefit consumer welfare. In 1984, while Bork was a judge in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, I was a vice president for mergers and acquisitions at Merrill Lynch’s investment banking division. We helped <a id="page-111"></a>Gulf Oil merge into Standard Oil of California, thus creating Chevron and cutting the number of major oil companies from seven to six. During the whole process, the question of antitrust problems never came up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Bork centered his interpretation of antitrust laws in the Chicago school libertarian economic theories of Milton Friedman. Bork came to the University of Chicago in the late 1940s as a true believer in Roosevelt’s New Deal politics and started dating a similarly liberal undergraduate, Claire Davidson. But as he began to get attracted to the intersection of economics and law, the conservative professors who dominated the Chicago faculty discouraged any belief that government could or should play a role in regulating business. The free market needed to function, unencumbered by government regulation. Whether they were motivated by a desire to advance in academia or a true change in belief, both Bork and Davidson (whom he married in 1952) came under the sway of the Chicago school and subscribed to its theories. From that point on he fought government regulation and continued to fight it for the rest of his life. As the <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> noted in his obituary, this stance cost him a seat on the Supreme Court: “He also wrote a fateful article for The New Republic in 1963—one that played a key role in his 1987 confirmation defeat—condemning the public accommodation sections of the proposed 1964 Civil Rights Act aimed at integrating restaurants, hotels and other businesses. Mr. Bork said he had no objection to racial integration but feared that government coercion of private behavior threatened freedom.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Google, Amazon, and Facebook are all monopolies <a id="page-112"></a>that would be prosecuted under antitrust statutes if it hadn’t been for Robert Bork. From the Ford administration all the way through to the Obama White House, Bork’s principles as expressed in <em class="calibre2">The Antitrust Paradox,</em> encouraging mergers and calling for less regulation, have ruled the antitrust division of the Justice Department. Just a few years after Bork published his book, Reagan’s soon to be appointed head of the antitrust division, William Baxter, told the <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> that he would “pursue an antitrust policy based on efficiency considerations.” As Barry Lynn points out in his book <em class="calibre2">Cornered: The New Monopoly Capitalism and the Economics of Destruction,</em> opposition to Baxter’s policy came from senators of both parties who argued that the Sherman Act, in which the word <em class="calibre2">consumer</em> never appears, was meant “not to lower prices but to protect the independent entrepreneur and to prevent a few among us from using our political and economic institutions to concentrate power in their own hands.”</p>
