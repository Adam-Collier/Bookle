<p class="noindent">It was after 5 a.m. in New Zealand on January 20, 2012, when the top-of-the-line Mercedes S-Class sedan pulled through the mansion gates under the chromed industrial-park letters spelling out <span class="small-caps">DOTCOM MANSION</span>. In the backseat was the man himself—Kim Dotcom—the most famous pirate in the world. As described by Charles Graeber in his epic <em class="calibre2">Wired</em> profile, Kim was dressed in baggy black hip-hop clothes that draped his three-hundred-pound frame. Massive jowls jutted out under blue tinted glasses, his hair almost in a buzz cut. His pudgy fingers were scrolling through his Twitter feed searching for reactions to his latest tweets. He had spent the last seven hours in a recording studio making a hip-hop album. His money had purchased the services of Black Eyed Peas producer Printz <a id="page-174"></a>Board, and though Printz may have been uncommonly circumspect about the quality of the tracks, Kim didn’t care, because he controlled the largest pirate music-file sharing site in the world, Megaupload, which he claimed had 180 million registered users. What he didn’t know was that on the other side of the world the FBI was about to seize the domain and shut down the site. Kim retired to bed but within minutes he heard the <em class="calibre2">thwack-thwack</em> of a police helicopter landing in his driveway, sending gravel rattling against his window.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It is when we encounter Kim Dotcom that libertarian philosophy gets taken to its logical end point. Kim may seem like an extreme figure, but he represents part of what has gone wrong with the Internet. Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, speaking at the Decentralized Web Summit, noted, “It’s been great, but spying, blocking sites, repurposing people’s content, taking you to the wrong websites—that completely undermines the spirit of helping people create.” What Kim Dotcom does is “repurpose people’s content” so that he receives all the profit and they get none. He also has an inflated sense of his own importance. After he was released from jail on bail, he recorded a song called “Mr. President.” “The war for the Internet has begun,” Kim raps. “Hollywood is in control of politics. The government is killing innovation. Don’t let them get away with that. I have a dream, just like Dr. King.” The song continues: “What about free speech, Mr. President? What happened to change, Mr. President? Are you pleading the Fifth, Mr. President?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Like Google and its allies on the copyleft, Kim equated <a id="page-175"></a>free speech with free music and movies. The libertarian cant of his pitch could have been written by Peter Thiel or Sean Parker. But Kim didn’t have the style of Sean Parker, so he was a rather unlikely leader of the new free-music movement. It took him thirty years of scams to get to that place, but it was the Internet that had always been his ticket to wealth—earned or scammed. With Megaupload he followed Peter Thiel’s principles of building a proprietary technology and a good brand with network effects that could scale. But before he arrived at the $175 million gold mine that was Megaupload, he had many a run-in with the law.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the early 1990s, bored with school in his native Germany, a teenage Kim began hacking into PBX exchanges—the large central telephone exchanges that most corporations used in the United States. He noted, “It was like moving to some little Swedish village with no locks on the doors. You got in, became a super-user, and basically owned the network. It was a bonanza.” Eventually he figured out how to scam Deutsche Telekom by setting up the German equivalent of a 1-900-number service. The phone company paid the operator a percentage of the charge, around fifteen cents per minute per call, so Kim could use the corporate PBXs he had hacked into to make hundreds of calls a night to his own service. The scam lasted for three years, and he made around $200,000 before he was arrested and sent to prison. In jail he says he was visited by representatives of MCI and AT&amp;T, eager to find out how their PBXs had been hacked so easily. When he got out he set up one of the first “white hat” hacking consultancies so he could sell his knowledge to major corporations. As Charles Graeber tells it, “He was in his <a id="page-176"></a>early twenties and getting paid, buying expensive custom cars and fine suits, renting yachts, throwing money around nightclubs, swaggering. Growing up he’d never felt particularly special. Now he had girls. He had a posse. He was featured in German magazine spreads.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">But he couldn’t resist the temptation of the con. He bought shares in a company called LetsBuyIt.com and announced that he was going to invest $50 million in revitalizing it. The stock popped 220 percent in a week and Kim sold most of his shares and left for Bangkok. The German securities regulator accused him of insider trading and stock manipulation. The press went wild, and when a German TV network found him in the presidential suite of the Bangkok Grand Hyatt, he basically told the regulators to leave him alone: “I told them that if this is how Germany treats their entrepreneurs, I don’t know if I ever want to be in Germany again. And that was a mistake.” It was such a mistake that the German prosecutor got the embassy in Bangkok to revoke his passport. Because he was then an illegal alien, the Thai police arrested him and threw him in a jail full of migrant workers. When the Germans offered him a two-day passport if he would return home, he surrendered. Arriving in Germany, he was the biggest crime story in the papers, the very definition of schadenfreude—the loudmouth hacker king brought low. He spent five months in jail, then decided to plead guilty in order to get out and leave the country.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He split for Hong Kong and in March of 2005 set up Megaupload. It was essentially a membership site where anyone could upload and tag a movie or music file. Members received service bonuses for uploading large numbers of files, <a id="page-177"></a>so they had an incentive to feed the site with stolen content. In two years Dotcom took in more than $175 million in revenue. He boasted that at the height of its popularity, Megaupload hosted twelve billion unique files for its 180 million members. US prosecutors claimed it represented 4 percent of the daily worldwide Internet traffic. Almost every movie and music file in existence was available on the site for free.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When Megaupload was shut down in 2011, pirate traffic simply moved to other sites. Since then, global piracy has continued to grow by nearly 20 percent per year, and more than 570 sites on the Internet are wholly dedicated to piracy.</p>
