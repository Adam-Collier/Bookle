<p class="noindent">The final tale of the pirates of the Internet concerns Dread Pirate Roberts, a.k.a. Ross Ulbricht, founder of Silk Road, the Internet drug marketplace that the FBI claimed grossed more than $1 billion between 2011 and 2013. Ulbricht’s life had been changed by reading Ayn Rand, and the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, the oracle of the modern American libertarian movement. According to Mises, a citizen must have economic freedom in order to be politically and morally free. Ulbricht wrote on his LinkedIn page that he wanted to “use [Mises’s] economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind.” With the arrival in 2009 of the anonymous currency Bitcoin, all the pieces were in place to unite Dread Pirate Roberts’s three obsessions: libertarian economics, the Dark Web, and drugs. He built Silk Road in two months and went live in January of 2011 with his own home-cultivated psilocybin mushrooms as a starter product. Within months he had sellers of heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine as well as prescription opioids <a id="page-187"></a>doing business on the site. The Silk Road took a cut of every transaction, following the same monopsony model that had been so successful for Amazon.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To access Silk Road, one had to use the Tor browser, another of the questionable innovations of the digital age. Tor stands for “the onion router,” which moves Internet traffic through a volunteer network consisting of thousands of relays to conceal a user’s location. Although Tor may have some legitimate uses—especially for political dissidents trying to avoid surveillance—its main use is as a means to reach the Dark Web, a cesspool of crime, child pornography, and sex trafficking that exists like a parallel universe apart from the Web most of us use. The online security firm Cloudflare reported that “94% of requests that we see across the Tor network are per se malicious.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Like the Internet itself, the onion router was originally developed with funds from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for the purpose of protecting US intelligence communications. Subsequently, funding for Tor came in part from John Perry Barlow’s Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the organization willing to defend the darkest conduct on the Web in the name of free speech. When University of Portsmouth computer science researcher Gareth Owen began a study of the Dark Web, he assumed it was mainly a place for political activism and anonymous whistle-blowing—the very activities EFF said it was supporting. But the results showed something starkly different: “Drug forums and contraband markets are the largest single category of sites hidden under Tor’s protection,” <em class="calibre2">Wired</em> reported, “but traffic to them is dwarfed by <a id="page-188"></a>visits to child abuse sites. More than four out of five Tor hidden services site visits were to online destinations with pedophilia materials.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Dread Pirate Roberts’s identity was finally uncovered not by the DEA or the FBI but by an unprepossessing IRS agent named Gary Alford working with the DEA out of an office in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Alford had become fascinated with the pirate and began to search chat rooms and blogs around the time of the Silk Road launch. He found a chat-room posting made within a few days of the launch of Silk Road from a poster named altoid. “Has anyone seen Silk Road yet?” altoid asked. “It’s kind of like an anonymous Amazon.com.” This was strange, because the site hadn’t launched yet, so he figured altoid was an insider. He started looking for other postings by altoid and came upon a curious request from earlier in 2013. In that post, altoid asked for some programming help and gave his email address: rossulbricht@gmail.com. Searching the web for Ross Ulbricht led to a young man from Texas who, just like Dread Pirate Roberts, admired Ludwig von Mises and Ron Paul. Alford was pretty sure he had the proprietor of Silk Road, but it took him more than three months to convince the FBI that this was their man.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Two months after Ross Ulbricht was arrested, the notorious cyberanarchist Cody Wilson, inventor of the world’s first 3-D-printed handgun, stood onstage in London at the MIT Bitcoin Expo and castigated his colleagues: “Ross Ulbricht is alleged to be the founder and operator of Silk Road, the glittering jewel of all things libertarian, black market, and wonderful. And it’s a severe indictment of the <a id="page-189"></a>modern libertarian conscience that he can’t get any support at all.” Perhaps that’s because Ulbricht used Silk Road to purchase the services of hit men to take out his rivals, who were threatening to assume control of Silk Road.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As Woody Guthrie once wrote, “Some will rob you with a six-gun, / And some with a fountain pen.” One could dismiss the bottom-feeders of the Dark Web, such as Kim Dotcom and Dread Pirate Roberts, as the outliers of our story, but in reality they both considered themselves anarcho-capitalists. Peter Thiel has flirted with that fringe belief, but one of the richest men in America, Charles Koch, has fully embraced it. He and his brother David have signed more checks with their fountain pen than any other Americans to ensure that the libertarian philosophy is heard in the highest reaches of our government.</p>
