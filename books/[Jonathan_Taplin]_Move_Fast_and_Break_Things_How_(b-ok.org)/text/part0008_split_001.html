<p class="noindent">It was raining like hell outside, and Doug Engelbart was pacing nervously on the stage. A tall, fit forty-three-year-old wearing a crisp white shirt and blue tie, with streaks of gray showing in his neatly parted hair, he looked like he could work for NASA or the Defense Department. And he did, in the sense that for the past several years the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), in Menlo Park, California, had funded his quixotic quest to invent the future.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In three hours the auditorium would be filled with the best computer scientists in the world, all gathered for the annual conference of the 1968 Association for Computing Machinery and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (ACM/IEEE). Computing machinery! As far <a id="page-50"></a>as the association was concerned, humanity had not left the industrial age, yet their members were about to enter the information age. Doug called the system he had built the oN-Line System (NLS), and in the 100-minute demonstration that would follow he planned to introduce the world to (in the words of Engelbart’s biographer Thierry Bardini) “windows, hypertext, graphics, efficient navigation, command input, videoconferencing, the computer mouse, word processing, dynamic file linking, revision control, and a collaborative real-time editor.” But for the moment no one was sure that what would later be called the Mother of All Demos would work. Doug had told someone at NASA earlier in the week that he was going to show the system publicly—“Maybe it’s a better idea you don’t tell us, just in case it crashes,” the NASA employee advised him. Doug’s chief engineer, Bill English, had been a theatrical stage manager and knew that the demonstration had to be ready as soon as the audience showed up. But what a show. Let Doug explain.</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">We set up a new Swiss video projector aimed at a 22-foot screen. On the right side of the stage I sat at a Herman Miller console with a display, keyboard, mouse and special keyset input device. We built special electronics that picked up the control inputs from my mouse, keyset and keyboard and piped them down to SRI over a telephone hookup. We leased two microwaves up from our laboratory in SRI, roughly 30 miles. It took two additional antennas on the roof at SRI, four more on a truck on <a id="page-51"></a>Skyline Boulevard and two on the roof of the conference center. On the console on the stage there was a camera mounted that caught my face. Another camera mounted overhead, looked down on the workstation controls. In the back of the room, Bill English controlled use of these two video signals as well as two video signals coming up from SRI that could bring either camera or computer video.</p>

<p class="calibre5">When the show started it was as if Engelbart had arrived from the future, “dealing lightning with both hands.” The effect on the thousand people gathered for the conference was revolutionary. Imagine the first performance of Stravinsky’s <em class="calibre2">The Rite of Spring</em> but without the boos and walkouts. People were thunderstruck by this radical upending of what a computer could be. No longer a giant calculation machine, it was a personal tool of communication and information retrieval.</p>
