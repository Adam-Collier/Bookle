<p class="noindent">Even though it was Ronald Reagan who created the break with historical antitrust policy, the blame cannot be placed on Republican administrations alone. As Barry Lynn points out, Bill Clinton’s “attitudes towards monopolization were even more favorable than those of Reagan or George H. W. Bush.” And even though Clinton and Gore ran in the 1992 presidential campaign as opponents of media monopolization, Lynn says, “their decision to allow the consolidation of U.S. media companies that had begun under Reagan to continue… cut the number of big firms from more than fifty to six.” And of course since Clinton, the libertarian theories of Robert Bork have continued to rule in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations and were reflected in a key 2004 opinion by Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia: “The mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system.” But Scalia is not alone. A study conducted by Lee Epstein at the University of Southern California, William M. Landes of the University of Chicago Law School, and Judge Richard A. Posner of the federal appeals court in Chicago found that five of the ten most business-friendly justices since 1946 sat on the Supreme Court in the last term that Scalia was on the court.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But how could it be that such a profound change in policy has escaped the notice of most Americans? Perhaps if you own a bar and only have one beer supplier (as the merger of the two beer giants A-B InBev and SABMiller <a id="page-117"></a>has been approved), then maybe the consequences of monopoly will reach into your life, but for most of us it goes unnoticed, even though its effects on our well-being are profound. As economist Yelena Larkin and her colleagues point out, increasing consolidation has reduced the number of US publicly traded firms by more than 50 percent (in half of US industries): “This decline in the number of firms has been so dramatic that the number of firms these days is lower than it was in the early 1970’s, when the real gross domestic product in the U.S. was one third of what it is today.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Two senior Obama economic advisers, Peter Orszag and Jason Furman, published a paper entitled “A Firm-Level Perspective on the Role of Rents in the Rise in Inequality,” which makes the argument that the rise in “super-normal returns on capital” at firms with limited competition is leading to a rise in economic inequality. They describe these firms as “rent seeking.”</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Economic rents are the return to a factor of production in excess of what would be needed to keep it in the market.… For example, capital can extract rents by engaging in anti-competitive behavior to earn revenues well in excess of opportunity cost.… Moreover, labor market structure can lead to some elements of monopsony in certain industries, slanting the division of this labor contract rent towards the firm.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">The classic example of rent seeking we all deal with is our cable service, which costs more than it should and is <a id="page-118"></a>less responsive than it should be because its local monopoly allows the company to make a better “deal” for itself. It is probably fair to ask whether Google, Facebook, and Amazon are rent-seeking firms—i.e., whether they monopolize the resources they use. Does the fact that Amazon can deny a publisher access to its vast customer base allow it to extract rents from publishers in excess of what it would be able to extract if there were multiple large sellers in the ebook market? Yes. Can Facebook and Google extract monopoly rents in excess of normal market prices from advertisers in return for the targeted access to their billions of users? Former assistant attorney general Thomas Barnett answered that question in his September 2011 testimony before the Senate antitrust subcommittee: “First of all, remember they [Google] are an advertising company. They made $30 billion last year [$60 billion in 2015] in advertising. And given that they’re dominant in advertising, a good portion of that is already monopoly rents.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Peter Orszag agrees, telling a Sydney, Australia, audience that Facebook and Google are “monopolies that are using our personal information without paying us and extracting a monopoly rent by selling ads based on that personal information.” So for Orszag and Furman, inequality has been rising between firms, not within them. Yes, CEOs still make more than workers, but Google, Amazon, and Facebook workers, with their extraordinary stock options, do far better than their peers in other industries. Tech giants such as Google and Facebook may have more to do with economic inequality than we realize. “It may be that we have dramatically mischaracterized a lot of what’s <a id="page-119"></a>driving increasing inequality in the US,” Orszag told the Sydney conference.</p>
