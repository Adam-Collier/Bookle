<p class="noindent">I understand that I could be accused of elitism by contrasting Francis Ford Coppola with PewDiePie. I plead guilty, but in part because I proudly spent the first thirty years of my career producing music, movies, and TV, I am eager to see those traditions continue. I also want to consume this kind of media—I don’t want to miss out on understanding what artists have to say about our culture. The question of how art lasts matters to me, and I think it should matter to you. I know that amazing music, film, journalism, and TV are being created by my children’s peers. In fact, my own daughter is making wonderful movies such as <em class="calibre2">Beasts of No Nation</em> and <em class="calibre2">The Kids Are All Right</em>. But I also know the incredible struggle she goes through to get each movie financed. So if the digital revolution has devalued the role of the creative artist in our society, then we need to do more than play around the edges. So often when I have given a speech on this topic to musicians, book publishers, moviemakers, and authors, I get what I have come to call a Stockholm syndrome response—“Isn’t this just <a id="page-280"></a>the way things are? Don’t we have to resign ourselves to working with Google, Facebook, and Amazon?” The audiences seem to parrot the techno-determinism that is, after all, just one way of understanding the problem.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think big changes could happen if we approach the problem of the monopolization of the Internet with honesty, a sense of history, and a determination to protect what we all agree is important: our cultural inheritance. We all need the access to information the Internet provides, but we need to be able to share information about ourselves with our friends without unwittingly supporting a corporation’s profits. Facebook and Google must be willing to alter their business model to protect our privacy and help thousands of artists create a sustainable culture for the centuries, not just make a few software designers billionaires. We also must understand that the men who run Google, Facebook, and Amazon are just at the beginning of a long project to change our world. Yuval Noah Harari calls their project Dataism:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Dataists further believe that given enough biometric data and computing power, this all-encompassing system could understand humans much better than we understand ourselves. Once that happens, humans will lose their authority, and humanist practices such as democratic elections will become as obsolete as rain dances and flint knives.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">We need to confront this techno-determinism now—with real solutions—before it is too late. I undertake the pursuit of these solutions with both optimism and <a id="page-281"></a>humility. Optimism because I believe in the power of rock and roll, books, and movies to upset the world. As the writer Toni Morrison observed, “The history of art, whether it’s in music or written or what have you, has always been bloody, because dictators and people in office and people who want to control and deceive know <em class="calibre2">exactly</em> the people who will disturb their plans. And those people are artists. They’re the ones that sing the truth. And that is something that society has got to protect.” I know that brave and passionate art is worth protecting and is more than just click bait for global advertising monopolies. I know it can change lives.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Certainly witnessing Bob Dylan go electric at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 turned this Princeton freshman who had previously been intent on being a lawyer into a passionate follower of the rock-and-roll circus—one who managed to make a good living from the entertainment business. My optimism also showed itself in 1996 when I helped found one of the first streaming video-on-demand services. Anyone crazy enough to found a service that needed broadband in 1996 had to be an optimist. My optimism led to humility, because the diffusion of broadband was much slower than I thought; I know that predicting the future is a humble man’s game.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think many in my generation have a utopian impulse (which is, it should be observed, different from idealism), but it is slipping away like a short-term memory. I feel I need to quote Dr. King again, who said the night before he was assassinated, “I may not get there with you, but I believe in the promised land.” My generation knew that <a id="page-282"></a>the road toward a better society would be long, but we hoped our children’s children might live in that land, even if we weren’t able to get there with them. It may take even longer than we imagined to rebuild a sustainable culture. If I were to predict the future, I would hope to see Tim Berners-Lee’s dream of a “re-decentralized” Internet, one that’s much less dependent on surveillance marketing and that allows creative artists to take advantage of the zero-marginal-cost economics of the Web in a series of nonprofit distribution cooperatives. I have no illusion that the existing business structures of cultural marketing will go away, but my hope is that we can build a parallel structure that will benefit all creators. The only way this will happen is that in Peter Thiel’s “deadly race between politics and technology,” the people’s voice (politics) will have to win. Google, Amazon, and Facebook may seem like benevolent plutocrats, but the time for plutocracy is over.</p>
