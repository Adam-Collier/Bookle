<p class="noindent">The idea of monopoly as the apotheosis of American capitalism goes to the heart of whether Tim Berners-Lee’s <a id="page-258"></a>vision of a “re-decentralized web” can actually be fulfilled. To my mind, Robert Bork’s notion that the only stakeholder that matters in antitrust considerations is the consumer runs counter to every belief Americans have held about the role of big business, from the foundation of the nation to the election of Ronald Reagan. Writing in <em class="calibre2">Mother Jones,</em> Kevin Drum notes:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">If we want a more dynamic economy, we should quit protecting large, hulking incumbents. Our key interest should be ensuring plenty of competition, not engaging in pointless arguments about consumer welfare—a concept that’s inherently fuzzy and far too easy to manipulate by smart corporate legal teams. To accomplish this, antitrust law needs to return to its older, cruder goal of simply keeping companies from getting too big and too dominant.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Clearly Thomas Jefferson and James Madison believed that controlling the threat of monopoly was so important to democracy that “freedom from monopoly” should be in the Bill of Rights. And as the power of business grew after the Industrial Revolution, the central battle of the early twentieth century was to break up monopoly trusts—a battle undertaken by Republicans Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft as well as Democrat Woodrow Wilson.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Equally important, we discovered in the age of information that “natural monopolies” are often rational ways to achieve efficient networks. This picture of what the streets of New York looked like in 1895 shows why sometimes natural monopolies make sense.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Clearly the proliferation of telephone and telegraph networks, none of them interoperable, was a kind of tragedy of the commons. No one got any network effects—which made the networks themselves almost useless. The solution was for two companies, AT&amp;T (then known as the Bell System) and Western Union, to consolidate the industries, buying up all the small operators and forming a natural monopoly. By the 1920s there was one phone company, one telegraph company, and only one communication wire into every home. But of course the government supervised these monopolies through the FCC. The Bell System had its rates regulated and was required to spend a fixed percentage of its monopoly profits on research and development that would be beneficial to the society at large.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In 1925 AT&amp;T set up Bell Labs as a separate operating subsidiary with the mandate not only to develop the next generation of communications technology but also to conduct basic research in physics and other sciences. Over the <a id="page-260"></a>course of the following fifty years, the transistor, the microchip, the solar cell, the microwave transmitter, the laser, and cellular telephony all were invented at Bell Labs, along with myriad other things we take for granted. Eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded to Bell Labs scientists. It was the most productive research facility in history; in fact most of the achievements of the digital age rest on its inventions. In the 1956 consent decree in which the Justice Department allowed AT&amp;T to maintain its phone monopoly, the government extracted a huge concession. As explained by Jon Gertner in his book <em class="calibre2">The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation,</em> “The phone company agreed to license its present and future U.S. patents to all American applicants ‘with no limit as to time or the use to which they may be put.’” All the past patents were licensed royalty-free, and all the future patents were to be licensed for a small fee. The government made this deal because it considered the phone system a utility.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Could the AT&amp;T remedies be applied to the natural monopoly called Google? First let’s tackle the definition of “public utility.” Have the services Google provides become so very, very central to the market that they have passed into the realm of utility? In finding for Google against the Authors Guild in an important case about Google’s digitization of thirty thousand books, judge Denny Chin said the service offered “significant public benefits,” even though Google was the only one profiting from it. So assuming one could argue that Google is a monopoly and needs to enter into a consent decree, would the Bell Labs model work?</p>
<p class="calibre5">If Google were required to license every patent it owns <a id="page-261"></a>for a nominal fee to any American company that asks for it, it would have to license its search algorithms, Android patents, self-driving car patents, smart-thermostat patents, advertising-exchange patents, Google Maps patents, Google Now patents, virtual-reality patents, and thousands of others. What is clear from the Bell Labs model is that such a solution actually benefits innovation in general. The availability of the Bell Labs transistor patents allowed the rise of Texas Instruments, Fairchild Semiconductor, and Intel. The cellular patents allowed Motorola to grow exponentially—only to be bought by Google for its patents. Bell Labs’ satellite patents created a whole new industry with many players. And we owe the current boom in solar energy to the original Bell Labs solar-cell patents.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It would seem that such a licensing program would be totally in line with Google’s stated “Don’t be evil” corporate philosophy and could spawn the birth of many new firms. However, Google’s use of patents has often crossed the line. They were censured by the FTC in 2012 over their efforts to block US imports of smartphones made by Microsoft and Apple by asserting that the devices, which rely on industry-standard technology, infringe patents owned by Google’s Motorola Mobility unit. Bert Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, stated that “there is a tough emerging attitude by antitrust regulators who’ve recognized that the failure to honor standard essential patent commitments needs to be treated much more severely than in the past.” Of course for such a remedy as I am proposing to work, some government agency would need to initiate a Google antitrust case. As I have pointed out, Google seems to have <a id="page-262"></a>the most successful regulatory capture strategy of any company in decades. Whether that will change after the election of 2016 is anyone’s guess, but it might just have to come from a state attorney general rather than the federal government, which seems to have totally bought into Robert Bork’s theory of antitrust.</p>
