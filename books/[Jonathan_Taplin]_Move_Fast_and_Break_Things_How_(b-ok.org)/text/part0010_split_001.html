<p class="noindent">Sean Parker, sitting in the back row of his afternoon world civilization class, was totally bored. He had stayed up most of the night before, hacking into the computers of a Fortune 500 firm that was at the heart of the American economy, and now he was having a hard time keeping his eyes open. A secretary to the principal came into the classroom and brought him a note saying that his father was waiting outside to take him to an orthodontist appointment. Sean didn’t wear braces. His heart began to race. He got up with a real sense of dread and left the classroom. His father had come downstairs at five o’clock that morning to find Sean at his computer, deep into the company <a id="page-90"></a>network, and flew into a rage. “So,” Parker recalled in a 2010 <em class="calibre2">Vanity Fair</em> article, “he grabbed the keyboard from my hands, ripped it out of the computer, and took it upstairs. I started crying and saying, ‘Dad! You don’t know what you’re doing! I have to log out!’ But he didn’t let me.” Within hours the FBI traced the hack to Parker’s IP address and, with assistance from his Internet service provider, raided his house. His dad, who had taught Sean computer programming when the boy was just seven years old, hauled him out of school and brought him home, where he was arrested. His father worked for the government as an oceanographer and, perhaps out of a sense of guilt over his role in Sean’s hacking obsession, managed to pull some strings. Because Sean was a minor he was sentenced to two hundred hours of community service instead of jail time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sean performed his community service with other delinquents at a local library. In what could have been a scene from <em class="calibre2">The Breakfast Club,</em> he met a “punk rock princess” there to whom he lost his virginity, and he connected online through a library computer with another hacker named Shawn Fanning. Together they would invent the beginning of the end of the music business as we knew it. Their software was called Napster, and its logic was simple. Every music CD consists of a digital file that can be ripped—that is, digitally extracted—and shared on a computer network. What was needed was a way to index all those MP3 files and allow users to share them for free. Because neither Parker nor Fanning is a musician, it doesn’t seem to have occurred to them the incredible damage their invention would inflict on the livings of artists for decades to <a id="page-91"></a>come. What they knew is that offering free music was the perfect way to drive traffic to their site on the still-sleepy Internet. Parker, of course, knew they were breaking the law, and his emails admitting that users were infringing copyright were used in the lawsuit filed by the record companies that eventually shut down Napster. Before it was shut down, in July of 2001, Napster had seventy million registered users. The chart below shows the precipitous fall in music revenues from the point when Napster went online.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If 1999 was the high point of the music business, the onset of Napster and all the pirate sites that sprang up after it was shut down was the low point. Those sites turned the recorded music industry from a $20 billion business to a $7.5 billion business. Imagine if any other industry had been cut by two-thirds because of counterfeiting.</p>
