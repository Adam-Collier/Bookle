<p class="noindent">In the summer of 1996 I founded with two friends (Richard Baskin and Jeremiah Chechik) one of the first streaming-video-on-demand companies, Intertainer. We raised a good bit of money from Comcast, Sony, Intel, <a id="page-139"></a>NBC, and Microsoft and had a working service to thousands of broadband customers in the fall of 1998. Unlike Napster or YouTube, we believed in asking permission, so we licensed movies and television programs from most of the major studios and paid them large guarantees for the service. I started the company because I had seen a demonstration at CableLab of video streaming over an early broadband test bed. The quality of the video wasn’t perfect, but the idea that you could get whatever video you wanted on demand, instead of going down to your local Blockbuster store, seemed pretty compelling. The people who built Intertainer were an extraordinary group of pioneers. They invented interactive tools that today form the basis for the video ad systems on the Internet. And pretty soon we were doing something—sending high-quality video over the Internet—that had never been done before. An article about Intertainer in <em class="calibre2">Business 2.0</em> in December of 2001 seems almost ironic when read from our present vantage point.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">For sheer cockiness, the business plan that Jonathan Taplin hatched with two friends in the summer of 1996 ranked right up there. Intertainer, as they named their company, promised nothing less than instant access to a vast electronic storehouse of movies, documentaries, and other fare, right from your own home. A couple of clicks and, to hear Taplin tell it, you could be watching Almost Famous or Ken Burns’s jazz series or the latest Eric Clapton video or the final game of the 1975 World Series, all with the VCR-like ability to interrupt the show whenever you felt like going out for a beer.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><a id="page-140"></a>The basic idea, called video on demand, or VOD, had been knocking around for years, as had Taplin himself. He was in his mid-40s—almost his dotage, by the entrepreneurial standards of the Internet Age—and he had suspiciously close ties to the entertainment industry establishment. He conceded nothing to his juniors, however, when it came to evangelical fervor. And indeed, if you stop to think about what home entertainment is and what VOD could be, the implications are dizzying. Such things as channels and schedules could eventually wither away. The whole idea of “watching TV”—that is, turning on the set and seeing what’s “on”—could come to be regarded as a peculiar and slovenly habit of the medium’s early days.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">But of course, as any pioneer knows, making one’s vision a reality is never easy. In early 2002, when we had around 150,000 customers, we heard a rumor that one of our shareholders, Sony, was quietly developing a service that looked just like Intertainer. When I asked them about it, they pleaded ignorance. And then one day in the summer of 2002 they announced the service, called Movielink, in a joint venture with Warner Bros., Universal Studios, MGM, and Paramount Pictures. Soon after that, the major studios stopped licensing films to Intertainer, and the service was forced to close down. This broke my heart, and I refused to take it lying down.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In September of 2002, Intertainer filed an antitrust suit against three major entertainment companies, AOL Time Warner, Vivendi Universal, and Sony as well as their wholly owned service Movielink in the United States District <a id="page-141"></a>Court for the Central District of California, Western Division, accusing them of conspiracy to fix prices in the digital distribution of entertainment and restraint of trade. In March of 2006, the defendants reached an out-of-court settlement with Intertainer. All I am allowed to say about the settlement is that “the lawsuit was resolved to the satisfaction of all parties.” It certainly was to the satisfaction of Intertainer, which is why I believe that well-enforced antitrust law can really help the little guy compete against corporate giants. Intertainer still exists and is currently in the business of licensing its video-on-demand patent portfolio. Companies such as Microsoft, Comcast, Thomson Reuters, Viacom, Discovery Communications, and Apple are currently license holders.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After years as a music and film producer, with a detour in the corporate world, my goal was to create a nexus between technology and entertainment. I knew that the combination of the digitization of all the world’s film libraries combined with a Moore’s law–type improvement in the quality of video streamed over the Internet would lead to a much more efficient video distribution system. Like my investors, I knew that creating a platform for the consumption of film was the place to innovate. We did that, and in the process we helped radically improve both the video quality and the back-end systems that allow users to get (as our first motto stated rather boldly) “anything, anytime, anywhere.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ultimately, as one executive from a company that licensed films to us put it, “the industry does not want an online HBO—another middleman.” Larger players in the <a id="page-142"></a>industry, working in concert with one of our own investors, formed a cartel that made it impossible for us to do business. Monopoly squelches innovation in all industries, and I saw just that happen at an early moment in the digital migration of entertainment. Perhaps if we had been doing business in 2010, we would have been bought rather than forced to close down. The counterfactuals for our current monopolistic environment are hard to accurately envision, but I lived one.</p>
