<p class="noindent">To answer the question of why Facebook is “spying and selling data,” one must understand why they need all your <a id="page-159"></a>data in the first place. The answer is simple. Facebook’s business model relies on selling advertising at a higher rate than most comparable Internet sites. It is here that the basic competition between Facebook and Google plays itself out. Whichever company can accumulate the most data on you can then sell highly pinpointed advertising at the highest price. For the moment, Facebook seems to be winning. At a time when Google ad rates are falling, Facebook announced in the fourth quarter of 2015 that “the average price per ad increased 21%, while total ad impressions increased 29% on a year over year basis.” The reason they get this premium is by microtargeting you. If I want to reach women between the ages of twenty-five and thirty in zip code 37206 who like country music and drink bourbon, Facebook can do that. Moreover, Facebook can often get friends of these women to post a “sponsored story” on a targeted consumer’s news feed, so it doesn’t feel like an ad. As Zuckerberg said when he introduced Facebook Ads, “Nothing influences people more than a recommendation from a trusted friend. A trusted referral is the Holy Grail of advertising.” Essentially Facebook has built a massive database of the consumer preferences of two billion people. As Bob Garfield, one of the most respected analysts in the advertising business, explains:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">This theoretically should be good for consumer marketers, and arguably helpful for consumers, notwithstanding the creepy sense of being shadowed through life. It also gives government or sinister data thieves a lot of data to get hold of and abuse. The intersection of surveillance <a id="page-160"></a>marketing, the security state and offshore organized crime suggests a scenario that Orwell, Koestler, Kafka, Huxley and Solzhenitsyn couldn’t have imagined at a peyote party.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Bob, who cohosts <em class="calibre2">On the Media</em> for NPR and was a columnist for <em class="calibre2">Advertising Age,</em> has never been known to mince words, which is why he is so helpful here. When the flacks at Google and Facebook defend their privacy policies, they always note that all the data is “anonymized.” But Garfield’s amusing response to that is right on:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">At the current trajectory, barring legislative, regulatory or judicial intervention, databases will grow exponentially and their use will become precise. The data profiles will remain, ahem, nominally anonymous, because no marketer has any interest in knowing the name of the consumer being monitored and targeted—merely that person’s checking account. That said, by overlaying databases of online activity, geolocation, purchasing behavior, etc., they will know more about your IP address than your wife knows about you.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">The problem of targeted advertising on the Internet extends far beyond Facebook and Google, though they are the two dominant players. In the first quarter of 2016, eighty-five cents of every new dollar spent on online advertising went to Google or Facebook, according to Brian Nowak, a Morgan Stanley analyst. So all providers of content, be they musicians, filmmakers, journalists, or <a id="page-161"></a>photographers, have to deal with Google or Facebook if they want to attract an audience.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For providers of content, programmatic advertising opens up a new battlefield in the fight to capitalize on your data. Needless to say you probably wonder why you are being shadowed by certain advertisers, no matter what website you are on. Let’s say you’re thinking of going to Las Vegas, so you check out prices at a Vegas hotel but don’t make a purchase. You now have a Vegas cookie on your computer. Next time you log on, as an ad loads in your Web browser, information about the page it is on and your cookies are passed to an ad exchange, which auctions that information off in real time to the Vegas advertiser willing to pay the highest price for it. The winning bidder’s ad is then loaded into the Web page nearly instantly. All this takes a few milliseconds. This is programmatic advertising, and there are two basic problems with the system, which now dominates Internet advertising.</p>
<p class="calibre5">First, it disadvantages quality content, because the advertiser is not interested in the content of the site. It is solely interested in targeting you. So there is no differentiation between NYTimes.com and a porn site. The <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> spends millions of dollars on its content and expects to receive premium ad rates based on the quality “environment” those ads will be featured in. But programmatic advertising destroys that whole value proposition.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The second problem for advertisers and content owners is the fraud issue, which almost no one in the advertising business wants to talk about. A 2015 article in <em class="calibre2">Bloomberg Businessweek</em> nailed the problem:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara"><a id="page-162"></a>Increasingly, digital ad viewers aren’t human. A study done last year in conjunction with the Association of National Advertisers embedded billions of digital ads with code designed to determine who or what was seeing them. Eleven percent of display ads and almost a quarter of video ads were “viewed” by software, not people. According to the ANA study, which was conducted by the security firm White Ops and is titled The Bot Baseline: Fraud In Digital Advertising, fake traffic will cost advertisers $6.3 billion this year.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">How could it be that American brands are willing to spend $6.3 billion advertising to bots? The first reason is that the current “ad tech” business is like the Wild West during the Gold Rush—filled with scammers. But all this is going to change. At a conference in February of 2015, LUMA Partners CEO Terry Kawaja noted that out of more than two thousand ad tech companies in the market, just 150 might survive. <em class="calibre2">Digiday</em> reported his speech with the ominous headline <span class="small-caps">WINTER IS COMING FOR THE AD TECH INDUSTRY</span>. The beneficiary of the consolidation will be Google and its ad tech subsidiary, DoubleClick, which together already have a huge share of this business and will be able to buy the smaller players when “winter” comes. Here is Bob Garfield again:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">I think legislators, regulators and litigators will eventually (and maybe soon) begin to bring the hammer down. Furthermore, as the world moves to mobile, which is a more cookie-free environment, the tracking is more difficult. I <a id="page-163"></a>think ad tech is its own worst enemy. Bot fraud, programmatic buying and ad blocking are costing marketers billions and compromising any advertising’s ability to reach actual humans, which means that the very digital marketing system that represents the threat is itself on a bad trajectory, perhaps toward implosion.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Garfield’s caution about ad blockers seems prescient. The digital marketing consultant Tune is projecting that ad blocking could reach 80 percent of smartphone owners by the third quarter of 2017. Apple has positioned itself in opposition to Google and Facebook in the ad-blocking wars because they have almost no advertising income. They support many ad-blocking apps on both the iPhone and iPad, much to the consternation of Google and the programmatic ad business. If the world of programmatic advertising does implode, it could look pretty ugly. But for publishers of quality content such as the <em class="calibre2">New York Times,</em> it could be a boon. The notion that advertising rates should be higher in an environment of quality has for years helped the publishers of the <em class="calibre2">Times</em> as well as companies such as Condé Nast. The world of programmatic advertising destroyed that connection, so maybe its demise might restore the premium rates that should accrue to high-quality content. But even if that were true, the best publications increasingly rely on Facebook to get readers. In 2014 online news sources such as <em class="calibre2">BuzzFeed</em> and <em class="calibre2">Huffington Post</em> got almost 50 percent of their inbound traffic from Facebook, and as the CEO of Bloomberg Media Group, Justin Smith, said, “The list is a lot longer than is publicly known of those <a id="page-164"></a>that have Facebook delivering half to two-thirds of their traffic right now.”</p>
