<p class="noindent">This book grew out of a speech I gave at the Aspen Ideas Festival in the summer of 2015. Thanks to Walter Isaacson, Charlie Firestone, Kitty Boone, and John Seely Brown for making that possible. My agent, Simon Lipskar, encouraged me to make it into a book and introduced me to my editor, Vanessa Mobley at Little, Brown and Company. It is Vanessa who truly helped me realize the vision of the book, and for that I am ever grateful.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Much of the development of the ideas in the book came during my tenure as a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California. I was fortunate to work under two extraordinary deans, Geoffrey Cowan and Ernest Wilson. I was also fortunate that I arrived at USC just as Professor Manuel Castells became a university professor at Annenberg. Manuel mentored me and got me to understand the power of networks. His work has informed me ever since. It was Dean Wilson who had the courage to support the Annenberg Innovation Lab that I have directed for the past <a id="page-286"></a>six years. At the Lab I was surrounded by the amazing intellects of fellows like Henry Jenkins, Francois Bar, Gabriel Kahn, Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, and Robert Hernandez. The staff who run the Lab—Erin Reilly, Rachelle Meredith, Sophie Madej, and Aninoy Mahapatra—helped make every project an adventure and taught me more than I could ever teach them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My experience in culture production has always been in the film, TV, and music businesses, so the guidance into the intricacies of book production provided by Ben Allen and Barbara Clark were invaluable. The same goes for Sabrina Callahan and Lauren Passell.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the battle for artist rights I have taken inspiration from my colleagues T Bone Burnett, David Lowery, Brian McNelis, Chris Castle, and Jeffrey Boxer. We all know it is a long fight against very powerful forces, but no one is giving in.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And finally a note of deep gratitude to my wife, Maggie, and our children—Daniela, Nick, and Blythe. Your lives have been an inspiration to me. Your love has anchored me.</p>
