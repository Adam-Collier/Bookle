<p class="noindent">Joshua Burwell, age thirty-three, was visiting San Diego in December of 2015 from his home in Sheridan, Indiana. As he strolled along scenic Sunset Cliffs after Christmas dinner, he plunged sixty feet to his death. Bill Bender, a San Diego lifeguard, told reporters, “Witnesses stated seeing someone distracted by an electronic device and he just fell over the edge. [He] wasn’t watching where he was walking[;] he was looking down at the device in his hands.” While the death of any screen-addicted person is tragic, what is also worrying is that we are building whole sectors of the digital economy on the concept of addiction. We <a id="page-214"></a>check our phones about 150 times a day—an average of every 6.4 minutes—according to a 2013 report.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From 1990 to 1991, I produced Wim Wenders’s epic road movie, <em class="calibre2">Until the End of the World,</em> set in 1999 on the eve of the millennium. One of the plot themes was the addiction many characters had to the small handheld screens they carried around. As a critic for the <em class="calibre2">Guardian</em> wrote, “What begins as a natural desire to understand one’s own past becomes an addiction to nostalgia. In 2015, their zombie-like wanderings, as they clutch handheld screens, take on new meaning. Of all the predictions Wenders made, this is by far the most striking.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">What does it mean to be human in the age of digital addiction? Or, more pointedly, if so much of our humanity is expressed online, what do we make of the fact that our mode of self-expression is the raw material on which a handful of companies grow rich?</p>
<p class="calibre5">On November 13 and 14, 2015, around one thousand activists and techies met at the New School in New York City to talk about reinventing the Internet. Their hope was to create a co-op model: individuals dealing directly with one another without having to go through data-scraping corporate hubs such as Google and Facebook. Douglas Rushkoff, a social critic and writer, noted that there’s too much focus on making sure that new innovations will be good for the <em class="calibre2">machines</em>. “I’m on Team Human!” he said at the conclusion of his talk.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The problem is that Internet designers are not treating us like humans; they’re treating us like lab rats. Shortly <a id="page-215"></a>after it was published I read a book called <em class="calibre2">Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</em>. The basic thesis of this very successful book is that in order to gain admission to the digital winner’s circle you need to get your customers addicted to your app. The “trigger, action, reward, investment” sequence is curiously close to that of the Skinner box we all studied in Psychology 101. As author Nir Eyal explains it, “At the heart of the Hook Model is a powerful cognitive quirk described by B. F. Skinner in the 1950s, called a variable schedule of rewards. Skinner observed that lab mice responded most voraciously to random rewards. The mice would press a lever and sometimes they’d get a small treat, other times a large treat, and other times nothing at all. Unlike the mice that received the same treat every time, the mice that received variable rewards seemed to press the lever compulsively.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Like the poor lab rat in pursuit of happiness who clicks on a bar for a reward pellet, we spend hours looking for “like” rewards on our social networks. Those with the most likes turn it into a form of currency, as was demonstrated in the myriad “gifting suites” at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, where popular YouTubers like iJustine “shopped” for free merchandise in exchange for posting about the swag to her three million subscribers. iJustine, whose fame stems from having posted a video on YouTube about her three-hundred-page iPhone bill, noted to the <em class="calibre2">New York Times,</em> “I love products, and I love sharing if I love something. Like, you can probably guarantee that it’s going to be posted, especially if I love it.”</p>
