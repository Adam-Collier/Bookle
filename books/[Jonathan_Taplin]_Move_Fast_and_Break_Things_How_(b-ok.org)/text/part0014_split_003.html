<p class="noindent">Mark Zuckerberg’s initial letter to investors when Facebook went public was titled “The Hacker Way.” He wrote, “The word ‘hacker’ has an unfairly negative connotation from being portrayed in the media as people who break into computers. In reality, hacking just means building something quickly or testing the boundaries of what can be done.” This emphasis on speed and subversion is embraced by much of the technology community. The problem, of course, especially as we move to the Internet of Things—the 6.4 billion Internet-connected sensors and devices—is that security is often an afterthought in building the latest shiny new object of our desire. In a preview of our future, the massive Internet outages experienced in October of 2016 <a id="page-181"></a>were triggered by (possibly Russian) hackers using the unsecured Internet of Things. As the <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> reported, “in a troubling development, the attack appears to have relied on hundreds of thousands of internet-connected devices like cameras, baby monitors and home routers that have been infected—without their owners’ knowledge—with software that allows hackers to command them to flood a target with overwhelming traffic.” As the Sun Microsystems CEO, Scott McNealy, said more than fifteen years ago, “You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Beyond the feelings of paranoia brought on by Russian hackers, the Internet of Things will bring new privacy and security worries. In 2015 more than 40 percent of the thermostats sold in the United States will be “smart thermostats,” many of them sold by Google’s subsidiary Nest. Most buyers of a Nest device don’t realize it’s capable of more than just lowering the temperature when you leave the house. The Nest is just the next step in Google’s data collection efforts. When the Pew Research Center asked Americans about their privacy concerns, they found “a scenario involving the use of a ‘smart thermostat’ in people’s homes that might save energy costs in return for insight about people’s comings and goings was deemed ‘acceptable’ by only 27% of adults, while 55% saw it as ‘not acceptable.’” The idea that Google would know when people were in your home and which rooms they were inhabiting was a bridge too far. But for some people, such as one jilted husband who had moved out of his house only to discover that his wife had moved her lover in, the smart thermostat is a blessing. This man wrote a glowing product review of the Honeywell Wi-Fi Smart Touchscreen <a id="page-182"></a>Thermostat, which he still could control from his smartphone even though he no longer lived in the house: “Since this past Ohio winter has been so cold I’ve been messing with the temp while the new love birds are sleeping. Doesn’t everyone want to wake up at 7 AM to a 40-degree house?”</p>
