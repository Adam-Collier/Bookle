<p class="noindent">If Google treats all content as a commodity against which it can place ads, what business is it really in? That’s right: <a id="page-135"></a>ad sales. Because the real value of Google and Facebook lies in the data mining. For them the difference between the supreme artistry of a Martin Scorsese short film and an amateur cat video lies only in the number of views that can be sold to advertisers. So it is in the advertising business that Google has its second major advantage, after regulatory capture. The extent of Google’s dominance in online advertising was laid bare on November 12, 2014. As the <em class="calibre2">Wall Street Journal</em> reported that day:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">A large swath of the Internet ran without advertising for over an hour Wednesday after Google’s online ad-serving system DoubleClick for Publishers went down. The outage caused websites run by publishers including <em class="calibre2">BuzzFeed, Time</em> and <em class="calibre2">Forbes</em> to show blank spaces where display ads usually run… Wednesday’s outages affected more than 55,000 websites, according to Dynatrace, which monitors website and web application performance for companies including eight out of the 10 largest retailers in North America.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Compared to its competitors, it is clear that Google owns the dominant share of online advertising. So instead of a competitive market for advertising keywords, Google runs an auction, which provides no transparency for the buyer other than the minimum price, set at Google’s discretion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But now Google is trying to extend its advertising monopoly into the world of TV. As I noted earlier, Google has key allies inside the FCC, which is now considering how to force cable and satellite companies to open up their <a id="page-136"></a>set-top box business to outside competitors through a technology it calls AllVid. Google could essentially offer local restaurants, auto dealers, and other advertisers a targeted interactive ad on its TV Search page that would be far more efficient than advertising on local TV stations. The effect of this would be to totally kill the local TV spot-advertising market, which funds most local news programming. We have seen what these kinds of competitive services have done to the newspaper business. Without advertisements from local business to support the presence of reporters at city hall, much local news is no longer covered.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Consultant Scott Cleland, former deputy US coordinator for international communications and information policy in the first George Bush administration, sees the hand of Google in this proceeding:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">At its simplest, what the FCC AllVid proposal does is force the regulated pay TV industry to create a Google-most-friendly IP search interface/portal into their proprietary pay TV offerings. That way Google would be enabled to index and then monetize their competitors’ most valuable proprietary information for free, by adding Google Internet ads as an overlay to competitors’ ad-supported content, and by skipping the ads of their competitors, to kneecap their competition’s relatively much smaller advertising businesses, and to devalue their competitors’ paid content assets made vulnerable by the FCC proposal.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">For a company that totally dominates the Internet ad business, the $73 billion TV ad market constitutes its only <a id="page-137"></a>hope to continue the 20 percent annual growth rate that shareholders have come to expect.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In 2015, an article in the <em class="calibre2">Guardian</em> stated, “Were Google a manufacturer, say, a monopoly such as it has over internet search would never be allowed.” But the ghost of Robert Bork is whispering in my ear: “Why does this matter to society? Where is the harm?” The same <em class="calibre2">Guardian</em> article says, “Google’s dominance is self-reinforcing, but also makes it more useful. Larger audiences improve Google’s data and make its products more accurate—as well as ever more impossible to avoid. As European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager acknowledged last week, we live in the Google age.” So the techno-determinist philosophy has even reached into the brain of Google’s most determined regulatory opponent. This theory of self-reinforcing dominance has often been called the network effect, or Metcalfe’s law, after PARC researcher Bob Metcalfe’s formula that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users. As more people use Google’s search engine, the company becomes exponentially more valuable. Could it be that Google is now what economists call a natural monopoly—a firm, such as a utility, that can supply an entire market’s demand for a service at a price lower than two firms could? In general, utilities are regulated by the government to protect consumers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As a society we are going to have to decide fairly soon whether Google, Facebook, and Amazon form a natural monopoly that needs to be regulated or whether we are going to pretend that competition and capitalism can exist in harmony in the digital age. They are existing in harmony <a id="page-138"></a>today because the counternarrative about the costs of digital innovation—and who bears those costs—has not been made. Peter Thiel knows that competition is anathema to the kind of capitalism he wants, but the regulators in Washington still live in a fantasy world of “perfect markets.” Gary Reback, one of the most prominent antitrust attorneys in Silicon Valley, has argued that they don’t. Reback noted to the <em class="calibre2">New York Times,</em> “Once one of these companies gets a monopoly, it’s easy to spread the monopoly to adjacent markets by acquisition. You would think antitrust enforcers would know this by now.” Do the regulators not see Google’s monopoly as a problem, or do they believe that Google’s political power is so great that the company is untouchable? Digital monopolies can either be part of the problem or part of the solution. But I’m doubtful that we can rely on their declarations of “Don’t be evil” while continuing this regime of unregulated monopoly. At this point, the economy in which we all live is shaped along the contours of Google, Amazon, and Facebook dominance. To propose that these firms trim their sails is to risk introducing chaos to an economy that not too long ago was brought to its knees.</p>
