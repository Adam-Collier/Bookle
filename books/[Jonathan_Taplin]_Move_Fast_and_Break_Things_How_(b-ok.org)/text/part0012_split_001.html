<p class="noindent">How have monopolies escaped regulation? Like its two peers, Facebook and Amazon, Google has used the tools of political lobbying and public relations to cement its unique market power. Regulation is at the mercy of politics, and as long as the free-market gospel that regulation inhibits growth is championed in Washington, monopolies will be free to proliferate. As the largest monopoly in the world, Google maintains the stance that governments are living in a twentieth-century world in which Google represents twenty-first-century business practices. The implied threat is that “regulators don’t get it,” even if those regulators are kept in check by Chicago school economic and legal doctrine. To maintain their power, Google, Facebook, and <a id="page-126"></a>Amazon not only have to be conscious of Justice Department strategy, they also have to keep a close watch on the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates advertising and ecommerce, as well as the Federal Communications Commission, which manages the rules of the Internet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Google is the largest company in America (ranked by market capitalization). It controls five of the top six billion-user universal Web platforms—search, video, mobile, maps, and browser—and it leads in thirteen of the top fourteen commercial functions of the Internet, according to Scott Cleland at the consulting firm Precursor, LLC. As Peter Thiel points out, companies like Google “lie to protect themselves. They know that bragging about their great monopoly invites being audited, scrutinized and attacked. Since they very much want their monopoly profits to continue unmolested, they tend to do whatever they can to conceal their monopoly—usually by exaggerating the power of their (nonexistent) competition.” This chart provides a look at the company’s (nonexistent) competition.</p>

<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-127"></a>Google’s winner-takes-all success is not just a factor of its technological superiority. Google spends a lot of money to make sure its political influence in Washington is felt in both the executive and legislative branches of government. The company spends more than $15 million per year on direct lobbying: on a par with the defense contractor Boeing. But Google has a platform to reach the public that is far more powerful than anything Boeing could deploy. On January 17, 2012, the film and music industries backed the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA): a proposed bill that aimed to crack down on copyright infringement by restricting access to sites that host or facilitate the trading of pirated content. The bill specifically targeted search engines such as Google that link to pirate sites. The day after the bill was introduced, Google put the following image on its search page for twenty-four hours. The image was viewed by 1.8 billion people.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Note the use of the word <em class="calibre2">censor</em> and the “tell Congress” line, which enabled you to message your congressperson. <a id="page-128"></a>Needless to say, the email servers of Congress were overwhelmed, and on January 20, 2012, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Lamar Smith, withdrew the bill. The very notion that getting Google to stop linking to criminal pirate sites constituted censorship is an exercise in Orwellian doublespeak. But the effect it had on legislators was to make them essentially Google captives. So much so, in fact, that Google was able to enlist many of them in its battle against the European Union, whose antitrust regulators seemed more willing to call Google a monopoly. As the <em class="calibre2">Guardian</em> reported, “Republican and Democratic senators and congressmen, many of whom have received significant campaign donations from Google totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars, leaned on parliament in a series of similar—and in some cases identical—letters sent to key members of the European Parliament.”</p>
