<p class="noindent">I had turned in my final exams at Princeton in early May of 1969 and did not wait around to attend my graduation later that month. My father, a fellow Princetonian who was deeply invested in my matriculation, had died of cancer three years before, at the age of fifty-eight. He was an antitrust lawyer fighting the government on behalf of monopolies such as Dresser Industries, the oil-field services giant, and I never got to ask him if he was happy with his life choices. I was eager to go to Los Angeles because I had gone to work for The Band four months earlier, setting up a recording studio for them in the hills above Sunset Plaza. I didn’t have a long view of my career, but in late May, as I followed Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm down to the pool house in Sammy Davis Jr.’s “pad” (complete with a <a id="page-34"></a>giant bed and mirrors on the ceiling), I felt I was at the right place at the right time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Robbie and Levon played for me what they had recorded during the three months I had been away finishing my course work. The first tune was “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,” and at the song’s end, tears welled up in my eyes. James Agee and Walker Evans had collaborated on <em class="calibre2">Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,</em> and it had opened a window for me into the life of the sharecropper. “Dixie” was like a musical version of that book. Even the black-and-white Elliott Landy portraits of The Band taken for the album hark back to the work of Walker Evans. The song gave me an understanding of Levon’s world that would last me the rest of my life. I never viewed the South with the same eyes again after that night.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the summer of 1965, I had started working part-time as a road manager for Albert Grossman, who was at the time the most important manager in the music business. His clients included Bob Dylan, Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, Paul Butterfield, Odetta, and the Jim Kweskin Jug Band. I carried the Jug Band’s guitars, banjos, fiddles, and washtub bass around the fields of the Newport Folk Festival on the epic July weekend when Bob Dylan “went electric” and angered the folk music establishment. For the following six years, I worked for Grossman, first as a weekend roadie, which gave me some money while I completed college, and then as a full-time tour manager for The Band, starting in the spring of 1969. That spring marked their debut at Bill Graham’s Winterland Ballroom, in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Levon Helm, The Band’s drummer, was born in May of <a id="page-35"></a>1940 in the middle of Arkansas cotton country, where his father eked out a living on a small plot of land in a town called Turkey Scratch. He was surrounded by music from the start—his father played the mandolin—but more important, he grew up in a crucial period of music history. As Levon would later explain in a film we made together called <em class="calibre2">The Last Waltz,</em> “It’s kind of the middle of the country, so if bluegrass or country music—if it comes down to that country and it mixes with blues and it dances, then it’s called rock and roll.” So Levon came into his adolescence just as a generation of rockabilly musicians five or so years older than he was—led by Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis—was making the blues accessible to a much wider audience in the still-segregated South. Eventually Levon began performing with his sister as a country act and then got to sit in on drums with Conway Twitty. He told me stories of watching the legendary blues harmonica player Sonny Boy Williamson play in West Memphis, Arkansas, for a fee of $10 per night. Williamson must have known that unless you were really lucky, it was hard to get rich playing music. Levon’s first bit of luck came courtesy of a musician from Fayetteville named Ronnie Hawkins, who drafted the seventeen-year-old Levon into his band.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Robbie Robertson, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel, and Rick Danko eventually joined Levon in Hawkins’s band. At some point they broke with Hawkins and went out on their own as Levon and the Hawks. It was then that they crossed paths with my boss, Albert Grossman.</p>
<p class="calibre5">One week after Dylan’s 1965 Newport Folk Festival appearance, Mary Martin and Dan Weiner of the Grossman <a id="page-36"></a>office showed up at Tony Mart’s, a roadhouse on the Jersey Shore, and told the Hawks that Bob Dylan wanted them to back him at two concerts: one at Forest Hills Stadium and the other at the Hollywood Bowl. Levon was skeptical and asked who else was going to be on the bill at the Hollywood Bowl; Danny said it was just Bob. The notion that someone with one minor hit on the radio (“Like a Rolling Stone”) could fill the seventeen-thousand-seat Bowl strained credulity. When it came to the world of folk music, the Hawks had been living in a parallel universe, and Robbie had to convince Levon that it couldn’t hurt for the two of them to just check it out for one gig while the rest of the boys held down the job at the roadhouse. Robbie and Levon went up to New York, rehearsed for a day with Bob (alongside Al Kooper on organ and Harvey Brooks on bass), and played in front of 7,500 fans at Forest Hills Stadium. Dylan’s compromise to appease the folkies was to play the first half of the show by himself with his acoustic guitar, then bring the group onstage to close out the night.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My first encounter with Levon’s band was later that same year, at their October Carnegie Hall performance. Dylan followed the same formula he’d adopted at Forest Hills, playing the first half acoustic and then coming out with Levon and the Hawks for the rock-and-roll second act. The music was fiery, passionate, outrageous—maybe even dangerous. Unlike the Newport performance (at which Dylan played with an unrehearsed pickup band), the music was tight, and Bob was in top form. He joked between songs and jumped around while Robbie Robertson threw out amazing guitar solos. Rick and Levon provided a rhythm section that <a id="page-37"></a>anchored the whole group with a driving intensity, bringing songs such as “Maggie’s Farm,” “Highway 61 Revisited,” and “Like a Rolling Stone” to a level Bob had never achieved on his recordings. Maybe it was the august atmosphere of Carnegie Hall, but the audience was respectful of the revolutionary new synthesis of folk’s lyricism and rock’s power. During the afterparty at Albert Grossman’s Gramercy Park town house, the mood was mellow yet congratulatory: Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgwick were just some of those paying court to Dylan and his crew. For Levon and the Hawks, it was an introduction into a new world of art and rock and roll. As Ronnie Hawkins had once promised, they were “farting through silk.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">But the fun was not to last. As soon as Bob and the Hawks began to tour the big arenas, pushback from the folkies escalated. The rock set would regularly be met with boos and shouts of “Traitor.” For Levon, it must have been dispiriting for other reasons as well: he was no longer the leader of the band, and he hardly ever got to sing backing vocals. After a year or so, he quit and went back to Arkansas while the rest of the group toured the world with a backup drummer, Mickey Jones. Eventually, in the spring of 1966, the scene got old for Bob as well, and, tired of the booing, he ended the tour and retired to his home in Woodstock, New York. Yet the dark mood of the moment still could not be escaped. Dylan, hurtling toward “Gates of Eden” along the dirt roads of Woodstock on a Triumph motorcycle, was tempting fate. It was perhaps unsurprising that he crashed, both literally and figuratively. As he later told <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> music critic Robert Shelton, describing the motorcycle accident <a id="page-38"></a>that changed his life, “It happened one morning after I had been up for three days.” It seemed to me that this was a sort of tap on the shoulder, delivering him back from the abyss. So when Bob began to recover under the loving care of his wife, Sara, he retreated into a world of children (three babies in three years), painting, and the quiet music of an earlier era.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The rest of the Hawks followed Bob to Woodstock and asked Levon to come back as well. When he agreed to do so, they formed a new version of the group, and Albert Grossman promised to get them a recording contract. Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, and Richard Manuel all began to write songs, drawing upon both the example set by Dylan and the kind of rockabilly music they had grown up with. Everyone in Woodstock called them The Band, and the name stuck. As promised, Albert made a deal with Capitol Records, and a young producer named John Simon was hired to produce their debut album.</p>
