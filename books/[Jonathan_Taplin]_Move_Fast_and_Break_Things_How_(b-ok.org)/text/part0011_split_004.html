<p class="noindent">The tightening monopolization of US industry is rendering America an oligarchy, with profound ramifications for our political system. After examining differences in public opinion across income groups on a wide variety of issues, the political scientists Martin Gilens of Princeton University and Benjamin Page of Northwestern University found that the preferences of a small number of corporations and the very rich had a huge impact on policy decisions while the views of middle-income and poor Americans had almost none. Gilens and Page write, “Our analyses suggest that majorities of the American public actually have little influence over the policies our government adopts.” The sociologist C. Wright Mills envisioned this in the mid-1950s in his classic book <em class="calibre2">The Power Elite</em>. He wrote, “The long-time tendency of business and government to become more intricately and deeply involved with each other has… reached a new point of explicitness. The two cannot now be seen clearly as two distinct worlds.” Mills could hardly have imagined the kind of power business exerts in the post–Citizens United world of billion-dollar political campaigns.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But it is in the world of digital media that the monopoly trend is most pronounced. As the <em class="calibre2">New Yorker</em>’s technology writer Om Malik put it, “Most competition in Silicon <a id="page-120"></a>Valley now heads toward there being one monopolistic winner.” Part of this is the network effect that Peter Thiel felt was so crucial, but part of it is also the unique nature of the Internet’s architecture. As Barry Lynn points out, “The entirely new fact is that the monopolist in the digital world enjoys a power that the monopolist in the physical world does not. This is the ability [not only] to isolate producers one from another and discriminate among them, but also to isolate consumers from one another and discriminate among them.” In antitrust law, an HHI score—according to the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, a commonly accepted measure of market concentration—is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm competing in a given market and then adding the resulting numbers. The antitrust agencies generally consider markets in which the HHI is between 1,500 and 2,500 to be moderately concentrated; markets in which the HHI is in excess of 2,500 are highly concentrated. The HHI in the Internet search market is 7,402. Off the charts.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Moreover, Amazon is nearly as dominant in its market as Google is in the search-engine market. The <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> reported on Amazon’s willingness to discriminate among publishers who were not willing to knuckle under to their terms:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Among Amazon’s tactics against Hachette, some of which it has been employing for months, are charging more for its books and suggesting that readers might enjoy instead a book from another author. If customers for some reason persist and buy a Hachette book anyway, Amazon is saying it <a id="page-121"></a>will take weeks to deliver it. The scorched-earth tactics arose out of failed contract negotiations. Amazon was seeking better terms, Hachette was balking, so Amazon began cutting it off. Writers from Malcolm Gladwell to J. D. Salinger are affected, although some Hachette authors were unscathed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Amazon has a near-monopoly position in the distribution of ebooks. The supreme irony is that government regulators are so clueless about the effects of monopoly that they brought an antitrust case against Apple in 2012 when Amazon had about 60 percent of the ebook market and Apple was a relatively minor player. But beyond books, Amazon captures fifty-one cents of every dollar Americans spend in online commerce.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It wasn’t supposed to be this way. The Web’s supposed low barriers to entry should have allowed a very competitive landscape, but it never happened. In search we have a monopolist in Google. In smartphone operating systems we have a duopoly in Apple and Google. And we soon might have a duopoly in home broadband service between Comcast and Time Warner (now called Spectrum). And certainly AT&amp;T and Verizon constitute a duopoly in mobile phone service. It turns out the Internet is very good at creating winner-takes-all scenarios.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The growth of monopoly creates a system that does not function the way classical economists believe market economies should. As the digital economy becomes a large component of our GDP and companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T dominate the Fortune 100, a reexamination of some of the deregulatory <a id="page-122"></a>nostrums of the Reagan era is in order. As Peter Thiel explains in <em class="calibre2">Zero to One,</em> the profit margins of true monopolies are extraordinary: “Google brought in $50 billion in 2012 (versus $160 billion for the whole airline industry), but it kept 21% of those revenues as profits—more than 100 times the airline industry profit margin that year. Google makes so much money it is now worth three times more than every U.S. airline combined.” The problem is that the enormous productivity of these companies, coupled with their oligopolistic pricing, generates a huge and growing surplus of cash that goes beyond the capacity of the economy to absorb through the normal channels of consumption and investment. This is why Apple has $150 billion in cash on its balance sheet and Google has $75 billion. These enterprises cannot find sufficient opportunities to reinvest their cash because there is already overcapacity in many areas and because they are so productive that they are not creating new jobs and finding new consumers who might buy their products. As former treasury secretary Lawrence Summers has put it, “Lack of demand creates lack of supply.” Instead of making investments that could create new jobs, firms are now using their cash to buy back stock, which only increases economic inequality.</p>
