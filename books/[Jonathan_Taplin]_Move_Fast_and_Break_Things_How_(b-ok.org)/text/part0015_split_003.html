<p class="noindent">So what have the Kochs accomplished with their thirty-five-year assault on our democratic process? Well, to begin with, they have delayed any serious attempt to halt climate change. Their money—more than that of ExxonMobil or any other oil company—has paid for the climate-change-denier propaganda machine. And this machine is very sophisticated. Investigators uncovered documents from the tech security firm HBGary Federal that describe an elaborate operation to unleash “denier bots” that would comment on any article supporting the notion that climate change exists. The software developed was called Persona Management, and it allowed a single operator to pretend to be hundreds of different people posting negative comments.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But perhaps more important, the Kochs’ vision of an antiregulation, antitax legislative environment has been realized, and with its realization has come the extraordinary income inequality which is so much a part of our story. The chart on the next page tells the story.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of the sixty-two richest people on the Forbes 400, twenty-six earned their fortunes from the media and tech businesses that are the subject of this book. The list of the top ten wealthiest people reads like our table of contents.</p>

<p class="calibre5">So only Warren Buffet and the Kochs do not owe their fortunes to technology. And only Buffet does not owe his <a id="page-201"></a>wealth to the power of monopoly capitalism. During the 2012 election, Mitt Romney famously cast the Forbes 400 billionaires as “job creators,” but a look into the workforce of the technology business would indicate that this is not really the case. Even though tech firms represent around 21 percent of the S&amp;P 500 (the five hundred largest American firms), they employ only 3 percent of the American workforce.</p>
