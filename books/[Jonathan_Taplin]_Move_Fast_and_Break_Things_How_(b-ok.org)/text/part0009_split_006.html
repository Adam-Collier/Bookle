<p class="noindent">It is Peter Thiel’s investment in Palantir that demonstrates a certain libertarian hypocrisy about corporate welfare. Thiel is always complaining about crony capitalism, but the initial investment in the company came from the CIA’s venture capital arm, and the firm is now valued at more than $10 billion. Palantir was founded three years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States and was set up as a data-mining company that could sell its services to the CIA. Palantir’s data-mining software has illuminated terror networks and figured out safe driving routes through war-torn Baghdad. It has also tracked car thieves and traced salmonella outbreaks. In one of the great ironies of history, US attorneys deployed its technology against the hedge fund SAC Capital, which was also an early investor in Palantir. Somehow, taking money from the CIA and aiding the NSA and FBI in tracking civilians does not <a id="page-85"></a>seem contradictory to the extreme libertarian Thiel. “I felt we were drifting to a place in the U.S. we’d have a lot fewer civil liberties and no real effective protection,” Thiel stated when asked why he started Palantir. The journalist Ben Tarnoff, writing in the <em class="calibre2">Guardian,</em> views Thiel’s subsequent embrace of Donald Trump’s economic plan as a rather cynical ploy to run the Palantir model at scale.</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Following this logic, what’s needed is a state that bankrolls scientific research at midcentury cold war levels—without the comparatively high tax rates and social spending that accompanied it. Corporations would mine this research for profitable inventions. The public would foot the bill and ask for nothing in return.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As Thiel moves into President Trump’s inner circle, we can expect the fortunes of Palantir to improve.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Born from the marriage of counterculture idealism and Defense Department funding in the 1960s, the Internet had by 2002 morphed into a vast commercial and government surveillance platform. The goal of Tim Berners-Lee and Stewart Brand—to construct a new platform for democratic communication—had been co-opted by a new cadre of libertarian <em class="calibre2">übermenschen,</em> a group of men who believed that they had both the brilliance and the moral fortitude to operate outside the normal strictures of law and taxes. These men believe in their “super human” qualities so deeply that they are investing millions of dollars in ventures like Thiel’s Halcyon Molecular, a company that purports to “create a world free from cancer and aging.” The <a id="page-86"></a>men believe that technology will eradicate the fundamental human anxiety that is fear of death.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The futurist Jaron Lanier once described Google chief scientist Ray Kurzweil and his concept of “the singularity”: the point in time when an artificially intelligent machine will be capable of autonomously building ever smarter and more powerful machines than itself. Lanier noted, “These are ideas with tremendous currency in Silicon Valley; these are guiding principles, not just amusements, for many of the most influential technologists.… All thoughts about consciousness, souls, and the like are bound up equally in faith, which suggests something remarkable: What we are seeing is a new religion, expressed through an engineering culture.” Bill Gates commented, “It seems pretty egocentric while we still have malaria and TB for rich people to fund things so they can live longer.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">But this is not stopping Thiel and Page in their pursuit of everlasting life. As the journalist Charlotte Lytton noted in December of 2015, “The 2045 Initiative—Dmitry Itskov’s life-extension organization seeking to transfer personalities onto non-biological items and, ultimately, immortality—projected that this year could be the first in which such a system was created.” I can’t imagine that Thiel and Page have really thought this concept of immortality through to its logical conclusion. Obviously the treatment would be extremely expensive and only available to the very rich. For the whole of history, the less well off have at least comforted themselves with the thought that death was evenhanded—even John D. Rockefeller was not going to be able to buy off the Grim Reaper. Imagine the <a id="page-87"></a>rage these immortality clinics would foment. The very rich, when they get to be 130 years old or more, would be so fearful of ordinary causes of death—a car accident, a plane crash, a terrorist bomb—that, having spent millions of dollars on immortality, they might be afraid to leave their mansions for fear of losing money on their investment.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I would say it takes no big leap to guess that both Peter Thiel and Larry Page truly believe that technology can deliver happiness. In a new book, <em class="calibre2">The Internet of Us: Knowing More and Understanding Less in the Age of Big Data,</em> Michael Patrick Lynch starts with a thought experiment: “Imagine a society where smartphones are miniaturized and hooked directly into a person’s brain.” Google’s Larry Page is already working on this. Then Lynch takes us several generations into the future, where we have stopped learning by observation and reason and have become totally dependent on the Google Now chip in our brains. And then imagine some disaster disables the worldwide communications grid. It would be, Lynch says, as if the whole world had gone blind. Not only would we have lost the knowledge to which we once had access, we also wouldn’t have the ability to learn anything new.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Bob Dylan once wrote, “To live outside the law, you must be honest.” In the 1990s, the challenge set before those libertarian entrepreneurs who would go on to survive the dot-com crash of 2000 would be to live that dialectic. They created a world dominated by tech elites, with a set of rules that we are now condemned to live by. Peter Thiel declared that “competition is for losers,” and the following decade would prove just who the losers would be.</p>
