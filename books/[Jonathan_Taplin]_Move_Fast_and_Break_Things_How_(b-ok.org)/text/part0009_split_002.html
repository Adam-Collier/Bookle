<p class="noindent">The sixteen-year-old chess prodigy Peter Thiel, bored by his high school in Foster City, California, was seized with libertarian fervor. The <em class="calibre2">New Yorker</em>’s George Packer sets the stage.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">He became a math prodigy and a nationally ranked chess player; his chess kit was decorated with a sticker carrying the motto “Born to Win.” (On the rare occasions when he lost in college, he swept the pieces off the board; he would say, “Show me a good loser and I’ll show you a loser.”) As a teenager, his favorite book was <em class="calibre2">The Lord of the Rings,</em> which he read again and again. Later came Solzhenitsyn and Rand.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Like Gilder, Thiel was outraged by feminism. By the time he showed up as an undergraduate at Stanford, his ideas on the subject were very close to Gilder’s. Years later, Gilder returned the compliment, as <em class="calibre2">Forbes</em> columnist Ralph Benko noted: “When George Gilder, arguably the smartest man in the world, says, as he said to me over dinner recently in Washington, DC, that Peter Thiel is the smartest man in the world… pay attention.” In a speech, Thiel later explained why he formed the <em class="calibre2">Stanford Review</em>: to fight feminism and political correctness on campus. He later made an outrageous statement on the Cato Institute website: “Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women—two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians—have rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron.”</p>
<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-71"></a>Staffed by Thiel’s fellow libertarians, such as David Sacks, the <em class="calibre2">Review</em> encouraged its readers to test the limits of free speech. One law student friend of Thiel’s named Keith Rabois decided to take the idea to the limit by standing outside the dorm residence of one of his instructors and shouting over and over, “Faggot! Faggot! Hope you die of AIDS.” The university community recoiled, and Rabois eventually withdrew from the law school. Thiel and his coauthor, Sacks, in their book <em class="calibre2">The Diversity Myth,</em> came to Rabois’s defense, writing, “His demonstration directly challenged one of the most fundamental taboos: To suggest a correlation between homosexual acts and AIDS implies that one of the multiculturalists’ favorite lifestyles is more prone to contracting the disease and that not all lifestyles are equally desirable.” Published in 1995, ten years before Thiel publicly declared his own homosexuality, the book is an extended rant against gay culture and racial and gender diversity—the “multiculture,” to use Thiel’s term—on the Stanford campus. He notes, “The multiculture exists to destroy Western culture, and this destruction has been ferocious and indiscriminate.” This deep contradiction—a gay man railing against diversity—is at the heart of our understanding of Thiel and the revolution he was about to lead.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thiel’s philosophical hero was Ayn Rand, whose first major novel, <em class="calibre2">The Fountainhead,</em> tells a tale of an individualistic architect, Howard Roark, who is depicted as a superior man struggling against the suffocating mob. Begun in 1937, a point when Rand was identifying herself with a small band of anti-Roosevelt partisans such as H. L. Mencken and <a id="page-72"></a>Albert Jay Nock, who were the first to use the term <em class="calibre2">libertarians, The Fountainhead,</em> along with Rand’s later novel, <em class="calibre2">Atlas Shrugged,</em> became the urtexts of the libertarian movement. The largest organized anti-Roosevelt group called itself the American Liberty League, which Rand’s biographer Jennifer Burns describes as “a secretive cabal of wealthy businessmen hoping to wrest control of the government from the masses.” Like her hero Roark, Rand believed the individual should “exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself.” Ultimately Rand had an almost Nietzschean will-to-power philosophy, which she handed down to followers such as Thiel. It plays out perfectly in these lines from <em class="calibre2">The Fountainhead</em>:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">“Do you mean to tell me that you’re thinking seriously of building that way, when and if you are an architect?”</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">“My dear fellow, who will let you?”</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">“That’s not the point. The point is, who will stop me?”</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">“Who will stop me.” This became the central tenet of Internet disrupters, from Thiel’s PayPal right up to Travis Kalanick’s Uber.</p>
