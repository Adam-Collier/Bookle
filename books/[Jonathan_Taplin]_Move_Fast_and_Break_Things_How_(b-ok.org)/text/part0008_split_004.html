<p class="noindent">At about the same time that Berners-Lee was creating the World Wide Web, Stewart Brand was creating the Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link (WELL). When it started, in 1985, it consisted of one computer in the Whole Earth office and a large group of Bay Area computer enthusiasts who could log on through a dial-up modem and have real-time text conversations on a variety of subjects. In his 1972 <em class="calibre2">Rolling Stone</em> article, Brand identified these enthusiasts as “hackers,” saying, “The hackers are the technicians of this science—It’s a term of derision and also the ultimate compliment. They are the ones who translate human demands into code that the machines can understand and act on. They are legion. Fanatics with a potent new toy.” The early WELL guidelines were very clear about intellectual property, as stated on the log-on screen: “You own your own words. This means that you are responsible for the words you post on the WELL, and that reproduction of those words without your permission in any medium outside the WELL’s conferencing system may be challenged by you, the author.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">But in 1989 something weird happened. The notion of the “hacker ethic” became a contested trope. It started with an online forum on the WELL organized by <em class="calibre2">Harper’s Magazine</em>. The subject was hacking, and Paul Tough, a <em class="calibre2">Harper’s</em> editor, had recruited Brand and a few of his most important WELL members, including Howard Rheingold, Kevin Kelly, and John Perry Barlow, to participate. Barlow, a shaggy, bearded man with a fondness for <a id="page-63"></a>colorful cowboy shirts, is a true American character. He is a failed Wyoming rancher, a former Catholic mystic, and a former Grateful Dead lyricist. He was also an early proponent of cyberspace as the new American frontier—as lawless as Wyatt Earp’s Tombstone. Barlow wanted it to stay that way, but his romantic notion of the hacker as countercultural brigand was about to be confronted with something more real and more dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the spirit of a hacker forum, the <em class="calibre2">Harper’s</em> editor invited two real hackers, identified only as Acid Phreak and Phiber Optik, to join the discussion. The debate over the definition of <em class="calibre2">hacker</em> soon got pretty heated. Fred Turner set the scene in <em class="calibre2">From Counterculture to Cyberculture</em>:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Among WELL regulars like… Barlow, hackers were cybernetic counterculturalists, creatures devoted to establishing a new, more open culture by any electronic means necessary. For Acid Phreak, hackers were break-in artists devoted to exploring and exploiting weaknesses in closed and especially corporate systems.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Barlow kept insisting that a computer network was like a small Wyoming town where people left their doors unlocked, but Acid Phreak would have none of it. In a fit of youthful fury, he hacked Barlow’s credit report and posted it on the WELL. Now the young hackers had Barlow hooked. He wanted to hang out with them. Maybe all his Jesse James fantasies were tied up in these kids, but it ended badly. On January 24, 1990, the Secret Service raided the apartment where Acid Phreak was living with his <a id="page-64"></a>mother. By the end of the day Acid Phreak, Phiber Optik, and a third hacker, Scorpion, were in a New York City jail, accused of hacking the main AT&amp;T computer system.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And that is where Brand, Barlow, and their fellow communards changed course. Instead of recalibrating the hacker ethic in line with their earlier goals, they embraced the criminals on the theory that theirs was really a victimless crime. Tell that to AT&amp;T, which had to spend millions restoring its system. Barlow went on to form the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has never met a hacker it couldn’t defend. No more defense of intellectual property for these boys—“Information wants to be free.” But of course that is a lie. As the science fiction writer Cory Doctorow has pointed out, “The desires of information are totally irrelevant to the destiny of the Internet, the creative industries, or equitable society. Information is an abstraction, and it doesn’t ‘want’ anything.” Even the most radical of the Valley’s libertarians, Peter Thiel, didn’t believe the “information wants to be free” nonsense, noting, “Every great business is built around a secret that’s hidden from the outside.” The EFF is a symbol of our current era, a time when hacker ideology trumps common sense. The group has gone as far as to defend “revenge porn” website owners who were ordered by courts to take down their sites.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the end Stewart Brand abandoned his communard dreams for a new calling: corporate consultant. He had gotten a taste of the power of a social network at the WELL. If a company could sponsor an online community and if it <a id="page-65"></a>could convince its customers that they were engaging in social rather than economic activity, then they could increase customer allegiance and their own profits. From this insight flowed the Global Business Network. Forget going back to the land—there was gold in preaching that Whole Earth message in the suites of the Fortune 500. The corporate conquest of the Web had started.</p>
