<p class="noindent">It would be easy to diss iJustine’s blurring of the line between opinion and eager receipt of free products if it weren’t the basic currency of the Internet age. What is the Kardashian empire but a walking product-placement opportunity? How would the TV and movie business survive without “brand-integration” dollars to top off the budget? And how would <em class="calibre2">Vox, BuzzFeed,</em> or even the vaunted <em class="calibre2">Atlantic</em> survive without the native advertising that blurs the line between editorial content and paid advertising? If indeed the author of <em class="calibre2">Hooked</em> is onto something—exposing our powerful addictions to social networking apps—then is Peter Thiel’s almost spiritual commitment to “liberty” really the same as Thomas Jefferson’s life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? I don’t think so. Is your friend who spends three hours a day on Snapchat really free? What agency do any of us have in our relationship with Facebook?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I am just as guilty as you are. I surrender all my personal data to Facebook in return for the ability to share my vacation photos with my friends. But Twitter and Facebook want more than the personal data of any one user. Each platform has become a critical tool in political campaigns. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump regularly boasted about his ten million Twitter followers, even though (according to the site StatusPeople, which tracks how many Twitter accounts are bots, how many are inactive, and how many are real) only 21 percent of Trump’s Twitter followers are real, active users on the <a id="page-217"></a>platform. Hillary Clinton didn’t fare much better, with only 30 percent of her followers classified as real.</p>
<p class="calibre5">During the 2012 presidential race, the Annenberg Innovation Lab studied Twitter and politics, and what we found was pretty disturbing. We created a natural-language-processing computer model that read every tweet about every candidate and sorted them by sentiment. At the beginning I loved reading the dashboard of the twenty most positive and negative tweets of the previous hour. But within weeks the incredible amount of racist tweets directed at our president became too painful to look at. The anonymity that Twitter provides is a shield that brings out the worst in humans. Plato (<em class="calibre2">Republic</em> 2.359a–2.360d) told a tale of the Ring of Gyges: when put on, it would render the wearer invisible. He asked the question: If we were shielded from the consequences of our actions, how would that change the way we act? We know the answer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As David Brooks says, we have created a “coliseum culture” in which a celebrity gets thrown to the lions on a weekly basis. Punishing strangers ought to be a risky endeavor. They can strike back and therefore threaten our long-term survival. Evolution, as Darwin pictured it, favors narrow self-interest. But the anonymity of the Internet shields the person who punishes the stranger. But also rewards us for exaggerating how we feel—the more outrageous tweet gets noticed. “It seems like our brains are wired to enjoy punishing others,” the psychologist Nichola Raihani said to <em class="calibre2">Wired.</em></p>
<p class="calibre5">Andy Warhol foretold our present YouTube lifestyle when he said, “In the future everyone will be world-famous <a id="page-218"></a>for fifteen minutes.” It was said with a touch of irony, because it was really a response to the question of why he would make a fairly homely drag queen like Holly Woodlawn one of his superstars. The brilliance, of course, lies in Warhol’s qualifier “<em class="calibre2">fifteen minutes</em>.” The fact that twenty-one reality TV stars have committed suicide between 2005 and 2015 confirms Warhol’s vision of the fleeting nature of fame in the twenty-first century.</p>
