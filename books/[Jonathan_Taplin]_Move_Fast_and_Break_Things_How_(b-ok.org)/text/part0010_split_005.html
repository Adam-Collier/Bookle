<p class="noindent">What we have been witnessing since 2005 is a massive reallocation of revenue from creators of content to owners of platforms. You have seen the dramatically dropping revenues in the music and newspaper businesses. Contrast that with this chart of Google revenue, an upward trend mirrored in the revenue growth of Amazon, Apple, and Facebook.</p>

<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-103"></a>More people than ever are listening to music, reading books, and watching movies, but the revenue flowing to the creators of that content is decreasing while the revenue flowing to the big four platforms is increasing. Each of these platforms presents a different challenge for creators. Google and YouTube are ad-supported “free riders” driven by a permissionless philosophy. Facebook, with its libertarian financier’s roots, takes much of the same stance toward content and advertising, but there are signs that its CEO has real ethical questions about where the company is going. Amazon, whose founder, Jeff Bezos, embraces the libertarian creed but has not taken the “don’t ask permission” route, has instead opened a new front: a relentless push to lower prices and commoditize content (especially books), which presents a different danger. And then there is Apple, the dissenter from the libertarian creed. Both Steve Jobs and Tim Cook have been real allies to the content community, and their stance against the surveillance-marketing model that is at the core of Google’s and Facebook’s businesses—i.e., their support of ad blockers—puts them in direct opposition to the dominant search and social platforms.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The tech elite’s jealous guarding of its own monopoly platforms is built upon blatant disregard for the artist’s intellectual property, a fact that came home to me in April of 2012 when I debated Alexis Ohanian, the founder of Reddit, at the <em class="calibre2">Fast Company</em> Innovation Uncensored event. Reddit is an online bulletin board where users can post <a id="page-104"></a>links on almost any topic (called subreddits). Various subreddits have been devoted to pornography, neo-Nazi propaganda, white power, Gamergate—all in the name of free speech. Since Reddit’s purchase by Condé Nast in 2006, the site has tried to rein in the most outrageous subreddits. But the task of reining in the ultralibertarian Reddit community became too much, and in the fall of 2011 Condé Nast sold off a large share of Reddit to a group led by Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, and Marc Andreessen. At the debate, Ohanian proudly mentioned his personal consumption of “free music and movies” available on the Internet, going so far as to say that musicians such as The Band need to earn their money from touring. From his point of view, Levon Helm had no right to make money from old recordings. Feeling that he may not have made a good argument at the conference, Ohanian wrote an open letter to me the next day, which <em class="calibre2">Fast Company</em> published.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Thanks for debating me this evening at Fast Company’s Innovation Uncensored conference here in NY! Like I said on stage, I wanted to offer a solution to help make right what the music industry did to members of The Band… I’m hopeful that innovations like the ones I discussed tonight and the others that are being worked on by entrepreneurs right now will continue to do right by artists and cut out those who’d mistreat them… Like I said on stage, it would be an honor to gather members of The Band together to produce one more album with unreleased content or something to honor Levon Helm—really any <a id="page-105"></a>kind of creative project they’d like to produce—(this time funded on kickstarter) and we’ll gladly launch it on the IAMA section of reddit.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara1">I replied in an open letter to him.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara1">Dear Alexis,</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara1">Last week at our debate, I talked about the essential unfairness that my friend and colleague Levon Helm had to continue to tour at the age of 70 with throat cancer in order to pay his medical bills. On Thursday, Levon died and I am filled with unbelievable sadness. I am sad not just for Levon’s wife and daughter, but sad that you could be so condescending to offer “to make right what the music industry did to the members of The Band.” It wasn’t the music industry that created Levon’s plight; it was people like you celebrating Pirate Bay and Kim Dotcom—bloodsuckers who made millions off the hard work of musicians and filmmakers.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">You were so proud during the debate to raise your hand as one of those who had downloaded “free music and free movies.” But it’s just your selfish decision that those tunes were free. It wasn’t Levon’s decision. In fact, for many years after The Band stopped recording, Levon made a good living off of the record royalties of The Band’s catalog. But no more.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">So what is your solution—charity. You want to give every great artist a virtual begging bowl with Kickstarter. <a id="page-106"></a>But Levon never wanted the charity of the Reddit community or the Kickstarter community. He just wanted to earn an honest living off the great work of a lifetime.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">You are so clueless as to offer to get The Band back together for a charity concert, unaware that three of the five members are dead. Take your charity and shove it. Just let us get paid for our work and stop deciding that you can unilaterally make it free.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ohanian did not respond.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The Internet was supposed to be a boon for artists. It was supposed to eliminate the “gatekeepers”—the big studios and record companies that decide which movies and music get widespread distribution. But a single statistic from the music industry puts a lie to this notion. When I started in the entertainment business, we talked about the Pareto curve, otherwise known as the 80-20 rule—the idea is that a movie or record company derives 80 percent of its revenue from 20 percent of its products. In other words, one in five movies becomes a big hit. In 2015, in the music business, 80 percent of the revenue came from 1 percent of the products. So Jay Z, Taylor Swift, and a few others got really rich, and most musicians made little or no money from their recordings. It could be that the very nature of search engines, which push the most popular items to the top of the search results, is reinforcing this winner-takes-all economy. Is a tiny percentage of constantly circulating material the rich diversity the Internet has brought us?</p>
<p class="calibre5">There is a deeper problem as music moves to an all-streaming format. Because services such as Spotify and <a id="page-107"></a>YouTube spew out terabytes of data that record companies can analyze, the whole business is becoming ever more data-driven. Data is fabulous for showing people what’s already popular, but it’s terrible for pointing the way toward art—great breakthroughs arising from something that has never been done before. Reliance on data leaves both Hollywood and the music business stuck in a remake-and-sequel culture—artifacts that data agrees will be successful. As the writer Kurt Andersen pointed out in <em class="calibre2">Vanity Fair,</em> “Even as technological and scientific leaps have continued to revolutionize life, popular style has been stuck on repeat, consuming the past instead of creating the new.” The death of David Bowie leads me to wonder if an artist like he could ever have a career in today’s music business. He didn’t make hits; he made complex works that took a while to understand. And even Bowie knew he was lucky to have started his career in a predigital age, before music had become a commodity, telling a reporter in 2002, “Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity. So it’s like, just take advantage of these last few years because none of this is ever going to happen again.” When you think that Bob Dylan’s first album sold four thousand copies in two years, you realize that today his contract would never have been renewed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The techno-utopians like Alexis Ohanian told us that the Internet would “kill all the gatekeepers.” But what’s really happened is that a new set of gatekeepers—Google and Facebook—has replaced the old. Google’s market capitalization is $532 billion. Time Warner’s is $61 billion. The balance of power in the world of entertainment has <a id="page-108"></a>shifted to monopoly platforms. To understand how that happened, we need to look at the nature of monopoly capitalism and how an old and largely discredited form of robber-baron capitalism took on a new form in the digital age.</p>
