<p class="noindent">To counter the meme that social networks lead to antisocial behavior, the PR wizards at Facebook and Google pushed forth the notion that social networks are the founts of democracy. In May of 2011, on the heels of the Arab Spring demonstrations, Google’s Eric Schmidt and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg each put on a suit and tie to appear at the G8 summit in Deauville, France. They were there to persuade world leaders to eliminate any regulation on their companies’ ability to collect data on their users. Zuckerberg pleaded, “People tell me on the one hand, ‘It’s great you played such a big role in the Arab spring, but it’s also kind of scary because you enable all this sharing and collect information on people.’ But it’s hard to have one without the other. You can’t isolate some things you like about the internet, and control other things you don’t.” So his pitch was, “If you want me to continue bringing down dictators, don’t regulate my business.” But a little distance from the Arab Spring lets us see that this is really a false choice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian Google employee who helped launch the Tahrir Square revolution in early 2011 that toppled Hosni Mubarak, tells the real story. His words come from a TED talk he gave after he was freed from jail and escaped Egypt.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara"><a id="page-222"></a>I once said, “If you want to liberate a society, all you need is the Internet.” I was wrong. I said those words back in 2011, when a Facebook page I anonymously created helped spark the Egyptian revolution. The Arab Spring revealed social media’s greatest potential, but it also exposed its greatest shortcomings. The same tool that united us to topple dictators eventually tore us apart.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">So what went wrong? According to Ghonim:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">First, we don’t know how to deal with rumors. Rumors that confirm people’s biases are now believed and spread among millions of people.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">Second,… we tend to only communicate with people that we agree with, and thanks to social media, we can mute, un-follow, and block everybody else.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">Third, online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs.… It’s as if we forget that the people behind screens are actually real people and not just avatars.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">And fourth, it became really hard to change our opinions. Because of the speed and brevity of social media, we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in 140 characters about complex world affairs. And once we do that, it lives forever on the Internet.…</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">Fifth—and in my point of view, this is the most critical—today, our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements, posts over discussions, shallow comments over deep conversations. It’s as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-223"></a>Though Ghonim was talking about his post-Tahrir experience, his is an almost eerie description of political conversations on Twitter in the United States and elsewhere. Social media may have been useful in getting people to come to a demonstration, but it proved useless in trying to organize an opposition once Mubarak had fallen. Perhaps more troubling is the fact that, according to the nonprofit organization Freedom House, autocracy has grown across the world since 2011, with seventy-two countries experiencing a decline in freedom and only forty-three improving. The organization notes the ability of governments such as those of China, Saudi Arabia, and Syria, to use the Internet as a tool for spying on their populations and points out that government monitoring of social media has increased dramatically since 2011. As Chinese blogger Su Yutong noted after she was forced to flee her country, “Some people say that for China [the] Internet is a gift from God. However, for Internet users in China, it is more like dancing in shackles.” But the Chinese plan to go much further in using the Internet to monitor their people, as the <em class="calibre2">Washington Post</em> reported in October of 2016:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Imagine a world where an authoritarian government monitors everything you do, amasses huge amounts of data on almost every interaction you make, and awards you a single score that measures how “trustworthy” you are.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">In this world, anything from defaulting on a loan to criticizing the ruling party, from running a red light to failing to care for your parents properly, could cause you to lose points.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><a id="page-224"></a>And in this world, your score becomes the ultimate truth of who you are—determining whether you can borrow money, get your children into the best schools or travel abroad; whether you get a room in a fancy hotel, a seat in a top restaurant—or even just get a date.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">This is not the dystopian superstate of Steven Spielberg’s “Minority Report,” in which all-knowing police stop crime before it happens. But it could be China by 2020.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">It is the scenario contained in China’s ambitious plans to develop a far-reaching social credit system, a plan that the Communist Party hopes will build a culture of “sincerity” and a “harmonious socialist society” where “keeping trust is glorious.”</p>
