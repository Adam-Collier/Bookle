<p class="noindent">So will Facebook really determine the future of journalism? What seems obvious in a world of <em class="calibre2">BuzzFeed</em> and <em class="calibre2">Huffington Post</em> being fed by Facebook is that the winning strategy seems to be to produce more content at a lower price. <em class="calibre2">Digiday</em> looked at the race for what some are calling peak content. What it found was that in 2010 the <em class="calibre2">New York Times,</em> with 1,100 people employed in the newsroom, created 350 pieces of original content per day and attracted 17.4 million page views per day. By contrast, the <em class="calibre2">Huffington Post,</em> with 532 people employed, posted 1,200 pieces of content per day (most of it created by third-party sites) and 400 blog entries (mostly unpaid), receiving 43.4 million page views per day. One can understand why the future of original journalism is threatened.</p>
<p class="calibre5">All this publishing may be attracting an audience, but as Steve Rubel, chief content strategist for Edelman, points out, “It’s our view that increasingly, content publishing is only visible if it makes it out to the platforms where most of the time, attention and dollars are now going.” And the two controlling platforms are Facebook and Google, although Apple is making an effort to move into this space. Visibility thus leads to profitability. This again raises the question I asked earlier: Will Facebook become a “rentier,” charging publishers for access to its 1.6 billion users? But maybe the larger <a id="page-165"></a>question is: Is this emphasis on quantity of output shoved onto platforms such as Facebook making us more or less informed? Does click bait coarsen our culture or just provide more amusement to alleviate our seemingly endless boredom? A tyrannical editor, equipped with all this data from Facebook about which article got the most “likes,” can turn a newsroom into a sweatshop where piece count is the measure of your productivity and determines your salary. This seems to me to be a rather dispiriting vision of our media future and one that Mark Zuckerberg, who reigns over the funnel through which almost every publishing enterprise pours, must reckon with. Evan Williams, one of the founders of Twitter, now running <em class="calibre2">Medium,</em> told the <em class="calibre2">Guardian</em> that he is worried about these “feedback loops”:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">If you look at feedback loops like likes and retweets, they’ve been very carefully crafted to maximize certain types of behaviors. But if we reward people based on a measurement system where there’s literally no difference between a one-second page view or reading something that brought them value or changed their mind, it’s like—your job is feeding people, but all you’re measuring is maximizing calorie delivery. So what you’d learn is that junk food is more efficient than healthy, nourishing food.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">If we are at peak content—the point at which the glut of things to read, watch, and listen to becomes completely unsustainable—then Zuckerberg will have to rethink his model. In August of 2016 Facebook announced it was changing its news-feed algorithm to try to cut down on <a id="page-166"></a>the amount of click bait that appears on the site. It remains to be seen how this will affect quality journalism organizations that are dependent on Facebook traffic.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For the time being, Zuckerberg’s answer seems to be to take even more control over news content. In March of 2015 Facebook partnered with news organizations such as the <em class="calibre2">New York Times, National Geographic,</em> and <em class="calibre2">BuzzFeed</em> to host content inside Facebook rather than linking to the news companies’ sites. Ostensibly the reason was that this way stories would load faster on a mobile device, and many news organizations found this to be an attractive proposition. Especially for a site like <em class="calibre2">BuzzFeed,</em> which is not getting a lot of advertising on its own site but rather creates custom stories that are essentially advertising disguised as editorial content (called native advertising in the trade), one can see the advantage of embedding the stories inside Facebook. But for real news organizations like the <em class="calibre2">New York Times,</em> the bargain is fraught with peril. Will Oremus, writing in <em class="calibre2">Slate,</em> explains the dilemma.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">News sites aren’t blind. They know it would be bad for them to cede control of their content—and, by extension, their relationships with readers and advertisers—to Facebook. And so if they could all get together and decide, as a group, what to do about Facebook, no doubt they’d think long and hard about the long-term sacrifices… But news sites don’t function as a collective. On the contrary, they operate as rivals for the same audiences and advertisers. And Facebook has made it clear that those who sign on early will see huge growth in their Facebook reach. If that <a id="page-167"></a>proves true, others will scramble to follow, even as it becomes clear they’re seeing diminishing returns. Meanwhile, the holdouts would see their Facebook audiences wither and die, as Facebook’s algorithms gradually downgrade posts that link out to third-party websites. Ultimately, links may become all but obsolete in the Facebook news feed.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Here we see the power of monopoly played out in the clear. What alternative does the <em class="calibre2">Times</em> have when faced with this choice? Emily Bell of the Columbia Journalism School, in an article entitled “Facebook Is Eating the World,” wrote, “I can imagine we will see news companies totally abandoning production capacity, technology capacity, and even advertising departments, and delegating it all to third-party platforms [such as Facebook] in an attempt to stay afloat.” I am hoping that the young CEO of Facebook will be willing to pause and think about where his company is taking the media business. Clearly most publications have come to accept that Facebook is a critical part of their audience-traffic ecology, but if they abandon attempts to build an audience for their own sites and just become article feeders for Facebook, they will eventually find themselves without a business rationale. As the University of California economist J. Bradford DeLong explained to me in a series of tweets, “Capitalism for information goods often goes badly wrong.”</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">It’s a standard saying in Silicon Valley: If you aren’t paying, you aren’t the customer, you’re the product. In a capitalist <a id="page-168"></a>economy, sellers have strong incentives to fulfill the needs of their customers—they want them back. But here the customers aren’t the viewers. The customers are the advertisers, who care whether the viewers watch, not whether the viewers are well informed.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">This is a problem for me because for the past twelve years I have been a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California. We are training a new generation of journalists for future jobs at places such as the <em class="calibre2">Los Angeles Times</em> and CNN—jobs that may not exist by the time they graduate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has said that newsroom employment at the nation’s 1,375 dailies could fall below 28,000, less than half the number of its high point in 1990. We are not teaching them how to write snarky tweets to gain followers but rather how to conduct an interview, write a lede, and shoot a short video. As Leon Wieseltier once wrote, “As the frequency of expression grows, the force of expression diminishes.” And as President Obama noted in a speech, “Ten, twenty, fifty years from now, no one seeking to understand our age is going to be searching the tweets that got the most retweets.” We certainly are not preparing our students for a career writing “sponsored content,” like the kind Jacob Silverman described in <em class="calibre2">The Baffler</em>:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Also called native advertising, sponsored content borrows the look, the name recognition, and even the staff of its host publication to push brand messages on unsuspecting viewers. Forget old-fashioned banner ads, those most reviled of <a id="page-169"></a>early Internet artifacts. This is vertically integrated, barely disclaimed content marketing, and it’s here to solve journalism’s cash flow problem, or so we’re told. “15 Reasons Your Next Vacation Needs to Be in SW Florida,” went a recent <em class="calibre2">BuzzFeed</em> headline—just another listicle crying out for eyeballs on an overcrowded homepage, except this one had a tiny yellow sidebar to announce, in a sneaky whisper, “Promoted by the Beaches of Fort Myers &amp; Sanibel.”</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">If most news organizations turn into <em class="calibre2">Gawker</em> or <em class="calibre2">BuzzFeed,</em> our students will probably find jobs, but they will be radically overqualified for the piecework journalism that may await them. But will they be comfortable writing an article in <em class="calibre2">The Atlantic</em> sponsored by the Church of Scientology entitled “David Miscavige Leads Scientology to Milestone Year”? The devaluation of news gets even scarier in the words of techno-triumphalists like Jeff Jarvis, a New York professor and media pundit. To Jarvis, anything is news, including an announcement on your smartphone that “there is a really good burrito place here.” Well, maybe, but is that what the two hundred thousand students studying journalism are going to do for a living? A computer can do that job, just as Reuters has computers turning most financial news releases into news stories.</p>
