<h2 class="sect3" id="calibre_pb_22">Chapter Eleven: What It Means to Be Human</h2>
<p class="hanging">Nir Eyal, <em class="calibre2">Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</em> (New York: Portfolio, 2014). Eyal takes B. F. Skinner’s conditioning model to its logical conclusion.</p>
<p class="hanging">Donald Trump’s fake Twitter followers can be found at fakers.statuspeople.com/realdonaldtrump.</p>
<p class="hanging">The best coverage of the Gamergate controversy has come from Caitlin Dewey of the <em class="calibre2">Washington Post.</em> The amount of bad information and gossip on this subject is astonishing.</p>
<p class="hanging">David Auerbach, “Letter to a Young Male Gamer,” <em class="calibre2">Slate,</em> August 27, 2014, www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/08/zoe_quinn_harassment_a_letter_to_a_young_male_gamer.html.</p>
<p class="hanging"><a id="page-296"></a>Michael Perilloux’s writing on Neoreaction can be found at www.socialmatter.net.</p>
<p class="hanging">Wael Ghonim’s Ted Talk, “Inside the Egyptian Revolution,” was filmed in March of 2011, www.ted.com/talks/wael_ghonim_inside_the_egyptian_revolution.</p>
<p class="hanging">Pico Iyer, <em class="calibre2">The Art of Stillness</em> (New York: Simon and Schuster/TED, 2014). This is a slim volume, but full of wisdom. It was his suggestion that sent me to the New Camaldoli Hermitage in Big Sur, California.</p>
<p class="hanging">Daniel Bell, <em class="calibre2">The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism</em> (New York: Basic Books, 1976). First published in 1976, it is somewhat dated, but many of Bell’s core findings still seem to apply to our current culture.</p>
<p class="hanging">Jacques Barzun, <em class="calibre2">From Dawn to Decadence</em> (New York: Harper Collins, 2000). This is one of the truly great cultural histories.</p>
<p class="hanging">John Seabrook, <em class="calibre2">The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory</em> (New York: W. W. Norton, 2016). This is a wonderful book on the modern pop-music business.</p>
<p class="hanging">Frans de Waal, “How Bad Biology is Killing the Economy,” <em class="calibre2">Evonomics,</em> March 2016, evonomics.com/how-bad-biology-is-killing-the-economy/.</p>
<p class="hanging">Henry Jenkins, <em class="calibre2">Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide</em> (New York: NYU Press, 2006). Jenkins and I don’t always agree, but he has been a constant source of inspiration and guidance for me at the Annenberg Innovation Lab.</p>
<p class="hanging">Neil Postman, <em class="calibre2">Amusing Ourselves to Death</em> (New York: Penguin, 1985). This was a pre-Internet look at the role of popular culture in pacifying the American public. His belief that Aldous Huxley’s vision of the future was correct is more true than ever.</p>
<p class="hanging">Mark Grief, <em class="calibre2">The Age of the Crisis of Man: Thought and Fiction in America, 1933–1973</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2015).</p>
