<p class="noindent">Why do antitrust laws matter, besides occasionally helping the little guy compete against corporate giants? To answer that question, we need to know that the fear of monopoly goes back to the founders of the American republic and the epic battle between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Hamilton, of course, represented the commercial power of New York and the financiers who held the <a id="page-113"></a>bonds that financed the revolution. Jefferson, the man of the people, had been sent to France in 1784 and became our minister to the country that had also helped finance the revolution. While he was there, the meetings in Philadelphia to draw up the Constitution were going on, and James Madison had to represent Jefferson’s point of view in the formation of the document. Jefferson’s major objection was that it included no bill of rights. He wrote Madison from Paris, having read the first draft.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">I will now add what I do not like. First, the omission of a bill of rights, providing clearly, and without the aid of sophism, for freedom of religion, freedom of the press, protection against standing armies, <strong class="calibre6">restriction against monopolies</strong> [emphasis added], the eternal and unremitting force of the habeas corpus laws, and trials by jury in all matters of fact triable by the laws of the land, and not by the laws of Nations.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Eventually, with Madison’s help, he got the assembled delegates to write the Bill of Rights, but the one clause Hamilton’s Federalists fought fiercely was “restriction of monopolies.” From his perch in Europe, Jefferson had firsthand knowledge of the corrupting power employed by monopolies such as the British East India Company. The company, which had an absolute monopoly on English trade in India and China, became so rich and powerful that in 1708 it loaned the nearly bankrupt British treasury three million pounds in return for extending its monopoly <a id="page-114"></a>for a much longer period. Jefferson also observed that the monopoly rents (the extraction of extra profit from a monopoly) the officers of the company enjoyed allowed them to come home to England and establish sprawling estates and businesses and to obtain political power. The company developed a lobby in Parliament that was so powerful that they could write legislation pledging British military might to protect their private trade routes. Jefferson had also read of the Great Bengal Famine of 1770, which resulted in the deaths of ten million people. The British East India Company forced Bengal farmers to grow opium—which the company intended to export to China—instead of food crops, resulting in a shortage of grain for the local inhabitants. Jefferson saw the havoc that unrestrained monopoly could deliver.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hamilton wanted to have it both ways, believing that capital should be free to influence politics but that politics should not be allowed to influence capital. He had already founded the Bank of New York in 1784 and was determined to found a national bank, 20 percent of whose shares would be owned by the US government. The remaining 80 percent would be owned by his friends. It would be a monopoly. In February of 1791, over the objections of Jefferson, Madison, and their allies, Hamilton got the bill passed through Congress. Jefferson, who was by then secretary of state, appealed to George Washington to veto the bill, but the president gave in to Hamilton, his secretary of the treasury. Thus the stage was set for American business to be ruled by giant corporations.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the end of the nineteenth century, men like John D. <a id="page-115"></a>Rockefeller and J. P. Morgan ruled combinations of companies called trusts. Faced with the real threat of monopoly, Congress passed the Sherman Act in 1890, which specified fines and imprisonment for anyone “who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations.” President Theodore Roosevelt used this law in his first term to break up Rockefeller’s Standard Oil trust and Morgan’s Northern Securities trust. Here are four of Roosevelt’s clear statements on the dangers of monopoly:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">The great corporations which we have grown to speak of rather loosely as trusts are the creatures of the State, and the State not only has the right to control them, but it is duty bound to control them wherever the need of such control is shown.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">The way out lies, not in attempting to prevent such combinations, but in completely controlling them in the interest of the public welfare.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">Corporate expenditures for political purposes… have supplied one of the principal sources of corruption in our political affairs.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">The absence of effective State, and, especially, national, restraint upon unfair money-getting has tended to create a small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their power. The prime need is to change the conditions which enable these men to accumulate power which it is not for the general welfare that they should hold or exercise.</p>
