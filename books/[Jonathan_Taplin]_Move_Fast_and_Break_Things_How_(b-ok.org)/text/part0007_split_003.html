<p class="noindent">Even though we were assured by pundits such as <em class="calibre2">Wired</em> magazine’s Chris Anderson, who wrote his seminal article “The Long Tail” in 2004, that digital abundance would mean a much more democratic distribution of the spoils of the digital <a id="page-44"></a>age, that notion has turned out to be willful self-deception. The long tail is a myth, a fact evidenced by the current music business, in which 80 percent of the revenue is generated by 1 percent of the content. Even at the height of the early blockbuster era, spawned by Michael Jackson’s <em class="calibre2">Thriller,</em> 80 percent of the revenue was spread among the top 20 percent of the content. So even in a different winner-takes-all scenario, the revenue was spread out among more artists than it is today. Economists have noted that winners “take all” in many sectors (including hedge funds), and that this has clearly contributed to global income equality, but in the digital media business it seems especially Darwinian. In a world where four hundred hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute of every day, the commodification of what was once considered an art (or at least a craft) has become inevitable. For all the stories promoted by Google about YouTube millionaires, the traffic statistics tell another story. Most YouTube videos have fewer than 150 views.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The same thing happens in the streaming music business, where in 2012 ad-supported services such as Spotify paid artists $0.0048 per track. One hundred thousand people listen to your track, and you make less than $500. YouTube is now the world’s dominant audio streaming platform, dwarfing Spotify and virtually every other service. Yet it pays artists and record companies less than a dollar per year for every user of recorded music, thanks to rampant piracy on its site. The problem has gotten so bad that, in 2015, vinyl record sales generated more income for music creators than the billions of music streams on YouTube and its ad-supported competitors. In 2015, after years of <a id="page-45"></a>battling pirates, Prince said in an interview that the Internet “was over for anyone who wants to get paid.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">So in the end Levon Helm’s problems are our problems. He was able to make great music because he stood on the shoulders of artists like Robert Johnson, Bessie Smith, Hank Williams, Muddy Waters, Maybelle Carter, Buddy Holly, and many others. Some of them died young from tragedy or self-destruction. But most of them got to live long lives making a joyful sound. Sustainable cultures are made by generations of artists able to ply their trade. We value the artists who came before us. Good film directors quote shot sequences from films they admire. And yes, there are small, vibrant communities of art and culture that are still living the life that cultural historian Jacques Barzun described as a renaissance: “The feverish interest, the opposition, and the rivalry among artists working, comparing, and arguing, generate the heat that raises performance beyond the norm.” Go to a traditional folk music festival. The quality of the playing and singing will blow your mind. But like the rise in vinyl record production, house shows, and other aspects of hipster culture, it is quintessentially “analog”—the sonic equivalent of the farm-to-table movement. The great electronic musician and producer Brian Eno, who has been working in funky analog studios in West Africa, has begun to question the very raison d’être of digital recording, which, thanks to Auto-Tune (the tech tool that allows engineers to correct singers with bad pitch), makes it possible to turn a second-rate singer into a diva: “We can quantize everything now; we can quantize audio so the beat is absolutely perfect. We can sort of do and undo everything. And of course, most of the records we like, <a id="page-46"></a>all of us, as listeners, are records where people didn’t do everything to fix them up and make them perfect.” Tech’s perfection tools do not make for human art.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The fiddlers and banjo pickers at the Union Grove Old Time Fiddlers Convention, in Union Grove, North Carolina, preserve their music as a hobby. Most of them have “day jobs” and play on weekends. But that doesn’t mean today’s professional artists develop their music in a vacuum. Clearly a radical artist such as Kendrick Lamar has spent a lot of time listening to artists who have gone before him—in Lamar’s case, they include the free jazz musicians Sun Ra and Charles Lloyd—yet most of his listeners have no idea who these previous artists are. The way Lamar passes great music to the next generation is critical to the notion of a sustainable culture.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I recall an evening at Levon Helm’s house in Woodstock in 1969 when he was trying to teach a young kid (me) about the concept of slowness in music. In many ways rock and roll seemed to be about speed—Little Richard’s rapid piano chords, Chuck Berry’s “Maybelline”—yet Levon was enamored with the idea of just how slowly you can play a song and still keep the rhythm moving forward. He put the record <em class="calibre2">Ray Charles Live</em> on the turntable and played “Drown in My Own Tears.” The beat of the song is unbelievably slow. The drums and bass seem to be in a time warp. Each line plays itself out as if it’s resisting coming to the end of the bar. “Drown in My Own Tears” is, of course, a blues tune, but the slowness exaggerates the sadness to such a level that you wonder whether Ray can get through the song. It reminds me of the note Dmitry <a id="page-47"></a>Shostakovich wrote to the players of his last string quartet (no. 15), completed in 1974. Each movement is marked adagio, and he wrote, “Play the first movement so that flies drop dead in mid-air and the audience leaves the hall out of sheer boredom.” That’s what the live recording of “Drown in My Own Tears” feels like, except that when Ray finally finishes, his audience goes absolutely crazy with joy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Levon gave me a gift that night. But how do we keep this sense of the arc of history and culture when we are flooded with the fierce urgency of now? How do we really take advantage of the Internet’s original purpose to decentralize its control and deepen our knowledge base?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps the answer lies in understanding the countercultural roots of the Internet.</p>
