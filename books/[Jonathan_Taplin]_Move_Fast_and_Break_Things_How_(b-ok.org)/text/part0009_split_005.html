<p class="noindent">But perhaps the greatest beneficiary of the no-taxes, no-regulation regime of the Internet has been Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon. Bezos was schooled in the libertarian ethos by his family. His stepfather, Miguel Bezos, had emigrated from Cuba after the rise of Castro and was an engineer for Exxon in Houston, Texas. Mike Bezos (as he is now known) contributed to Gary Johnson’s Libertarian Party presidential campaign in 2012. Jeff Bezos outlined his core libertarian philosophy in an interview for the Academy of Achievement:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">I think people should carefully reread the first part of the Declaration of Independence. Because I think sometimes we as a society start to get confused and think that we have a right to happiness, but if you read the Declaration of Independence, it talks about “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” Nobody has a right to happiness. You should have a right to pursue it, and I think the core of that is liberty.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Bezos was working at the hedge fund D. E. Shaw in May of 1992 when the Supreme Court ruled in <em class="calibre2">Quill Corp. v. <a id="page-79"></a>North Dakota</em> that “the lack of a physical presence in a state is sufficient grounds to exempt a corporation from having to pay sales and use taxes to a state.” For Bezos, who studied the growth of the Internet while at Shaw, a light went on. He began to imagine an online retailer that could totally disrupt the local bookstore business. His principles were very similar to Thiel’s four guidelines. First he would build a proprietary online platform (even going so far as to patent “one-click” ordering). Then he would harness the network effect, using user recommendations to build individual taste profiles of every customer. He would also create economies of scale by buying in bulk from publishers and negotiating the lowest prices, which individual bookstores could not match. In this effort he could use the wholesaler Ingram in order to list those titles he was not buying from publishers, thereby dramatically expanding the number of books he could offer on Amazon and still avoid charging sales tax. And finally he would build a brand around the name Amazon, which he chose both for its connotation of scale—the world’s largest river—and its position in the alphabet: because it starts with <em class="calibre2">A,</em> it would be at the top of most lists. By 1994, Bezos had quit his hedge fund job and set Amazon up in Seattle, reasoning that the state was sparsely populated, so the majority of his customers would come from outside the state and therefore would not pay sales tax.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By 1997 Amazon was growing so fast that it was putting many local bookstores out of business. Legislators in several states began to lobby for imposing sales tax on Amazon. The economist Dean Baker has estimated that <a id="page-80"></a>Amazon’s tax-free status amounted to a $20 billion tax savings to Bezos’s business. Baker notes, “In a state like New York, where combined state and local sales taxes average over 8.0 percent, Amazon could charge a price that was 1.0 percent below its brick and mortar competition, and still have an additional profit of 7 percent on everything it sold. That is a huge deal in an industry where profits are often just 2–3 percent of revenue.” Bezos, eager to preserve this subsidy, went to work in Washington, DC, and got Republican congressman Christopher Cox and Democratic senator Ron Wyden to author the Internet Tax Freedom Act. The bill passed and was signed by President Bill Clinton on October 21, 1998. Although not barring states from imposing sales taxes on ecommerce, it does prevent any government body from imposing Internet-specific taxes. Between the passage of the ITFA and 2015, Amazon essentially managed to wipe out the local bookstore and, to some extent, the local record store from the American landscape. During those years, 2,300 independent bookstores (as well as the Borders chain) and 3,100 record stores closed their doors. The cultural critic Leon Wieseltier angrily noted, “The streets of American cities are haunted by the ghosts of bookstores and record stores, which have been destroyed by the greatest thugs in the history of the culture industry.” The bitter irony is that Amazon noticed that a few independent bookstores in big cities were still thriving, so it decided to go into the bookstore business itself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But Amazon is not alone in its avoidance of taxes. <em class="calibre2">Bloomberg Businessweek</em> reports, “The tactics of Google <a id="page-81"></a>and Facebook depend on ‘transfer pricing,’ paper transactions among corporate subsidiaries that allow for allocating income to tax havens while attributing expenses to higher-tax countries. Such income shifting costs the U.S. government as much as $60 billion in annual revenue, according to Kimberly A. Clausing, an economics professor at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.” At a time when both local and federal governments are putting off needed infrastructure improvements because of tax revenue shortfalls, the tax avoidance schemes of our richest technology companies are partially to blame. But of course Amazon is the leader in this regard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">According to <em class="calibre2">Publishers Weekly,</em> “Research conducted in March of 2014 by the Codex Group found that in the month Amazon’s share of new book unit purchases was 41%, dominating 65% of all online new book units, print and digital. The company achieved that percentage by not only being the largest channel for ebooks, where it had a 67% market share in March, but also by having a commanding slice of the sale of print books online, where its share in March was estimated at 64%.” Amazon’s political influence has only grown as it managed to persuade the Justice Department to sue—successfully, as it turned out—Apple’s tiny ebookstore for antitrust violations, thereby increasing Amazon’s monopsony power. The economist Paul Krugman explains that, “in economics jargon, Amazon is not, at least so far, acting like a monopolist, a dominant seller with the power to raise prices. Instead, it is acting as a monopsonist, a dominant buyer with the power to push prices down.” And this dominant power of Amazon <a id="page-82"></a>extends around the globe. As Farhad Manjoo pointed out in the <em class="calibre2">New York Times,</em> “The larger Amazon gets, then, the more its rules—rather than any particular nation’s—can come to be regarded as the most important regulations governing commerce.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">So not only was Amazon able to confound local regulations, it was also able to use lax regulatory supervision to push the boundaries of occupational safety in its massive un-air-conditioned warehouses. Business historian Simon Head, in his book <em class="calibre2">Mindless: Why Smarter Machines Are Making Dumber Humans,</em> writes that Amazon is a “prime example of how in the early twenty-first century, state-of-the-art information technologies can be used to re-create the harsh, driven capitalism of the pre–New Deal era.” In 2011, the <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> noted a report from an Allentown, Pennsylvania, paper on conditions at the Amazon warehouse in town where temperatures inside reached 110 degrees:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">So many ambulances responded to medical assistance calls at the warehouse during a heat wave in May… that the retailer paid Cetronia Ambulance Corps to have paramedics and ambulances stationed outside the warehouse during several days of excess heat over the summer. About 15 people were taken to hospitals, while 20 or 30 more were treated right there, the ambulance chief told <em class="calibre2">The Call</em>.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">For a libertarian like Bezos, the notion of installing air-conditioning in his giant warehouse goes against his notion of liberty. You don’t have a right to a decent <a id="page-83"></a>workplace; you merely have the right to pursue it, ostensibly by quitting and looking elsewhere for work. But if you do decide to continue working in an Amazon warehouse, you will be subject to the kind of twenty-first-century monitoring that Frederick Taylor—the late nineteenth and early twentieth century management consultant and efficiency expert famous for his studies of “time and motion”—would have marveled at. All employees have a personal GPS monitor that tells them which route to walk in the warehouse to get to the next item they need to pack and exactly how many seconds they have to get there. If they do not complete the trip in the time Amazon specifies, they will get a notice and a demerit—repeated failures to meet the time targets will lead to dismissal.</p>
<p class="calibre5">These same workers know that Amazon is “looking out for them” in a different way. When they pass through the airport-style body scanners at the warehouse exit and punch the digital time clock at the end of their shifts, they are confronted by large-screen monitors that display images of several of their former coworkers in silhouette, each of whom has been fired for theft. Each image has the word <em class="calibre2">terminated</em> stamped across the body of the malefactor next to a rap sheet listing what he stole, when he stole it, and the value of the merchandise. Perhaps this is Amazon’s libertarian version of the Puritans’ public stocks. All that’s missing is a scarlet <em class="calibre2">T</em> tattooed on their foreheads.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For all his libertarian distrust of government, Bezos has never stopped trying to use government to his advantage. Some say he bought the <em class="calibre2">Washington Post</em> so he could have powerful influence in the nation’s capital. Certainly the <a id="page-84"></a>purchase would not make sense on a pure return-on-investment basis. Bezos knows this because he already has taken advantage of publishers. In June of 2009 James Moroney, publisher of the <em class="calibre2">Dallas Morning News,</em> testified in Congress about his negotiations with Amazon over publishing the newspaper’s content on the Amazon Kindle. Amazon demanded 70 percent of the subscription revenues, leaving him with 30 percent to cover the cost of creating 100 percent of the content. This, he noted, could hardly be characterized as a fair business deal.</p>
