<p class="noindent">The unreality of the world of tech billionaires came home to me when I spent two days in 2015 at an invitation-only conference with Graydon Carter, editor in chief of <em class="calibre2">Vanity Fair,</em> and the swells of Silicon Valley in San Francisco. The conference, called the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit, left me wondering whether there isn’t a kind of bubble in the Valley that has nothing to do with the inflated valuations of the “unicorns” (private companies worth more than $1 billion), which were so much a focus of conversation onstage and envy offstage—especially from <a id="page-211"></a>established Hollywood moguls, who are drawn to Graydon Carter like moths to a flame.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The real bubble is a thought bubble, in which the magical thinking of the guys who clearly believe they are the smartest cats in the room goes completely unchallenged. Case in point: Elon Musk, who said that he will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on his quest to inhabit Mars, going so far as to suggest that we cause a nuclear explosion on the planet in order to melt all that frozen water, warm the atmosphere, and enable us to grow vegetables for future space colonies. Musk proposed this with a straight face, and neither the interviewer nor the other panelists even blinked. Musk went on to impugn Larry Page’s expenditure of tens of millions of dollars so he could live to the age of two hundred, remarking that he, Musk, would be happy to live to one hundred. By that time he might be able to upload his brain to a computer so we could all take advantage of his brilliance ad infinitum. I suppose it is a tribute to the cultural cachet of Silicon Valley that they have now replaced Hollywood as the apple of Graydon Carter’s eye.</p>
