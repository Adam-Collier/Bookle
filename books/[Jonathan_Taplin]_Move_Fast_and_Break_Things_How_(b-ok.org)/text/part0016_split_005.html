<p class="noindent">When tech plutocrats invoke the concept of freedom, what do they mean? Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It’s obvious now that the freedom brought to us by the libertarian elite will not come with jobs. The fact that Facebook is on track to generate annual revenues of $20 billion with fewer than fifteen thousand employees speaks volumes. Is Peter Thiel’s idea of corporations—<em class="calibre2">free</em> to reap monopoly profits and operate <em class="calibre2">free</em> from government regulation—what we want for our country? Thiel’s icon Ayn Rand defined freedom this way: “To ask nothing. To expect nothing. To depend <a id="page-225"></a>on nothing.” How far is this from Jefferson’s great inspiration, the Greek philosopher Epicurus, who defined the good life and freedom in the following terms?</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bl-list">• The company of good friends.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• The freedom and autonomy to enjoy meaningful work.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• The willingness to live an examined life with a core faith or philosophy.</p></div>
<p class="calibre5">If we think about the world techno-utopians are envisioning, it may be hard for the average citizen to have the freedom and autonomy to enjoy meaningful work. Would a life where your daily existence relied on driving four hours a day for Uber, serving as a concierge for your Airbnb guests in the spare room, and spending your evenings doing crowdwork on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk meet Epicurus’s test? And would you have any time to live an “examined” life? Is the goal of tech success freedom, or addiction?</p>
