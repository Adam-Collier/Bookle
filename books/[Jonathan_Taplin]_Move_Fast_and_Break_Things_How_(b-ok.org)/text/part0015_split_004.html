<p class="noindent">Is it ridiculous to believe that technology will fuel the engine of the American jobs recovery? Before we answer that, let’s ask two other questions. First, why are American firms (mostly tech) sitting on $1.9 trillion in cash? As Adam Davidson wrote in the <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em>:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Take, for example, Google. Its new parent company, Alphabet, is worth roughly $500 billion. But it has around $80 billion sitting in Google’s bank accounts or other short-term investments. So if you buy a share in Alphabet, which has sold for roughly $700 lately, you are effectively buying ownership of more than $100 in cash. With $80 billion, Google could buy Uber and its Indian rival Ola and still have enough left over to buy Palantir, a data-mining start-up.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">One possibility for this anomaly is that the entrepreneurs heading these firms have most of their wealth in the stock of their companies and they would rather use the cash to support the stock (through buybacks) than <a id="page-202"></a>make long-term investments, which might take years to show results.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The second question we need to ask is posed by the economist Robert Gordon in his book <em class="calibre2">The Rise and Fall of American Growth</em>. Gordon argues that the hype around the technology revolution is overdone and that digital services are less important to productivity than any one of the five great inventions that drove economic growth before 1970: electricity, urban sanitation, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, the internal combustion engine, and telecommunications. Yes, it’s nice to have a phone and a computer in your pocket, but has it really changed the world the way the inventions of Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, and Henry Ford did? Even Peter Thiel has remarked, “We wanted flying cars; instead we got 140 characters.” For Gordon, the future may be characterized by stagnant living standards, rising inequality, falling education levels, and an aging population. This chart, taken from Gordon’s book, puts the lie to notions about the computer revolution introducing radical productivity.</p>

<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-203"></a>Not a pretty picture. It isn’t a leap to think this stagnation could lead to much deeper social conflict. Anarchist collectives, for instance, have taken to attacking the luxurious private buses Google uses to ferry workers from San Francisco to its Silicon Valley campus. A flyer handed out during one of the protests read, “You are not innocent victims. You live your comfortable lives surrounded by poverty, homelessness and death, seemingly oblivious to everything around you, lost in the big bucks and success.” The late famous venture capitalist Tom Perkins decided to defend Silicon Valley’s 1 percent in a rather awkward way in a letter to the editor of the <em class="calibre2">Wall Street Journal</em>: “Writing from the epicenter of progressive thought, San Francisco, I would call attention to the parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on its ‘one percent,’ namely its Jews, to the progressive war on the American one percent, namely the ‘rich.’” Perhaps written from the deck of Perkins’s yacht (one of the world’s largest), the letter was an embarrassment for the other partners at Kleiner Perkins.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This sense of class strife in San Francisco could be just a preview of a darker scenario brought about by the robot and artificial-intelligence revolution that Google, Amazon, Facebook, and others are investing in, including the “Uberization” of many tasks. Platforms such as Amazon’s <a id="page-204"></a>Mechanical Turk allow firms to outsource online piecework, or “crowdwork.” As Mary L. Gray reports in the <em class="calibre2">Los Angeles Times,</em> “Researchers at Oxford University’s Martin Programme on Technology and Employment estimate that nearly 30% of jobs in the U.S. could be organized like this within 20 years. Forget the rise of robots and the distant threat of automation. The immediate issue is the Uber-izing of human labor, fragmenting of jobs into outsourced tasks and dismantling of wages into micropayments.” The workers on these platforms have no job security and no benefits. In addition, the prices for this piecework can be lowered radically as more people come on board the platforms from all over the world. Neil Irwin, writing in the <em class="calibre2">New York Times,</em> notes, “So Uber alone may not be a major force reshaping the nature of work. But the same technologies that made it possible could be making employers more interested in building a work force of nonemployees. A weak job market has probably given them more ability to make it a reality.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">The classic notion of “global labor arbitrage” (capital will always seek out the lowest-priced labor in a globalized economy) works at scale here. Researcher Sara Kingsley at the University of Massachusetts found real problems with the crowdwork model.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">A direct and limitless supply of labor and tasks should produce a perfectly competitive market; however, data collected from our yearlong study of crowdwork suggests that the reverse is true. Rife with asymmetric information problems, crowdsourcing labor markets are arguably not just imperfect, but imperfect by design.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-205"></a>Kingsley found that Amazon could constantly lower the piecework price it paid on Mechanical Turk and that it was continually opening up new low-labor-cost countries, such as India, to the platform. Given that Amazon runs a monopsony book business, it’s no surprise that it might apply the same techniques to other business sectors. But it is not only people working out of their homes doing crowdwork who are going to be threatened. Dan Bindman, writing in the publication <em class="calibre2">Legal Futures,</em> reports that “robots and artificial intelligence (AI) will dominate legal practice within fifteen years, perhaps leading to the ‘structural collapse’ of law firms.” And yet integrating AI into ordinary tasks is not so easy. In 2016, Microsoft deployed an AI chatbot on Twitter called Tay, targeted at people between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four, in what was billed as research “in conversational understanding.” As the <em class="calibre2">Guardian</em> reported, the experiment was a disaster.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">But it appeared… that Tay’s conversation extended to racist, inflammatory and political statements. Her Twitter conversations have so far reinforced the so-called Godwin’s law—that as an online discussion goes on, the probability of a comparison involving the Nazis or Hitler [increases]—with Tay having been encouraged to repeat variations on “Hitler was right” as well as “9/11 was an inside job.”</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Tay had been hijacked by Internet trolls engaged in a long-standing video-game ritual called griefing, in which <a id="page-206"></a>the trolls compete for attention, as blogger Anil Dash has explained to the <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em>: “Once a target is identified, it becomes a competition to see who can be the most ruthless, and the ones who feel the most powerless will do the most extreme thing just to get noticed and voted up.” Peter Lee, who led the artificial intelligence group at Microsoft Research, vowed to “work toward contributing to an internet that represents the best, not the worst, of humanity.” That might be harder than he thinks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In 1930 the British economist John Maynard Keynes wrote that in the future we would have to worry about “technological unemployment… due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.” It could be that in the next ten years we will have arrived at the point where Keynes’s prophecy comes true. A 2013 paper by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University suggested that 47 percent of US jobs are at high risk of being automated. That list includes accountants, lawyers, retail sales personnel, technical writers, and many other white-collar professions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In a series of tweets, Marc Andreessen put a positive spin on Lord Keynes’s challenge: “Posit a world in which all material needs are provided free, by robots and material synthesizers.… Imagine six, or 10, billion people doing nothing but arts and sciences, culture and exploring and learning. What a world that would be.” But the <em class="calibre2">New Yorker</em> writer Tad Friend confronted Andreessen with our present reality: “When I brought up the raft of data suggesting <a id="page-207"></a>that intra-country inequality is in fact increasing, even as it decreases when averaged across the globe—America’s wealth gap is the widest it’s been since the government began measuring it—Andreessen rerouted the conversation, saying that such gaps were ‘a skills problem,’ and that as robots ate the old, boring jobs humanity should simply retool.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Characterizing Keynes’s “technological unemployment” as just a “skills problem” seems shortsighted. The notion that a fifty-year-old autoworker replaced by a robot is going to retrain himself as a software coder and apply for work at Google seems to be a pipe dream that only someone as rich and insulated as Marc Andreessen could conceive. But that is not to say that we shouldn’t think about Keynes’s and Andreessen’s vision of a world in which most of us have a lot of leisure time. If Frey and Osborne are right, and 47 percent of jobs may be automated in the next two decades, then we face one of two possible futures. The dystopian future of mass unemployment and psychological alienation leading to deep social unrest is one we have already seen in <em class="calibre2">Blade Runner</em>. The only present remedy is to create millions of low-wage “bullshit jobs”—the writer David Graeber’s term. Graeber notes, “Huge swaths of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they believe to be unnecessary. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually no one talks about it.” This is not a world any of us wants to live in, let alone work in. <a id="page-208"></a>Already in the United States we know that the labor-force participation rate for men between the ages of twenty-five and fifty-four who have only a high school diploma is at historic lows as this chart demonstrates.</p>
<div class="width1">
<div class="pc">
<img src="../images/00014.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre1"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">The only way out of this crisis—to realize Andreessen’s vision of six billion people dabbling in art, science, and culture—is to have some version of a universal basic income (UBI), free health care, and a deep reduction in the length of the workday. Already some employers in Sweden are cutting their workday to six hours, and Finland is experimenting with a guaranteed income. These are not impossible goals, yet Andreessen can still posit a future in which a deep <a id="page-209"></a>social safety net exists without the most modest proposed changes to the status quo, such as free college tuition and universal health care.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The “let them eat cake” disdain from Andreessen, Silicon Valley’s most famous “machine owner,” is not surprising. The philosopher Samuel Freeman, in an essay entitled “Illiberal Libertarians: Why Libertarianism Is Not a Liberal View,” wrote, “Libertarianism resembles feudalism in that it establishes political power in a web of bilateral individual contracts. Consequently, it has no conception of legitimate public political authority nor any place for political society.” This of course is the world the Koch brothers would like to live in. Larry Page, Marc Andreessen, and Mark Zuckerberg would be embarrassed to admit to holding such feudal views, yet their attitude toward the role of political authority is in line with the Kochs’. This will be the coming battle: a war between those who foresee a democracy that continues to uphold its obligations to its citizens regardless of their net worth and one in which market imperatives have become so fully assimilated that the only citizens who count are those within a very small subset (7.1 percent of GDP) of the technology sector. The definition of the word <em class="calibre2">plutocracy</em> is a society ruled or controlled by the small minority of the wealthiest citizens.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The Koch brothers and their allies in a post–Citizens United world are doing what they can to make this plutocracy a reality. David Koch celebrated on election night with Donald Trump, and the following morning, Koch ally and vice president–elect Mike Pence announced that Marc Short, who had run the Koch’s Freedom Partners, would be a <a id="page-210"></a>“senior advisor” to the Trump administration. And the tech community is free-riding on the Kochs’ power. The tech hatred of antitrust laws, privacy regulation, taxation, and copyright protection is seen as the key to their future. Many tech leaders espouse progressive ideas, but their embrace of libertarian principles is the more accurate indicator of their political outlook. Grover Norquist, the libertarian antitax advocate who vowed to “shrink the government to the size that he could drown it in a bathtub,” told <em class="calibre2">Vox</em>’s Ezra Klein that the only things keeping Silicon Valley money in the Democratic Party were cultural issues. With “gay marriage off the table,” he said, “it could be a very easy case” to persuade the big Silicon Valley players to give money and support to the Republicans, who oppose teachers’ unions, oppose regulating the sharing economy, and are wholeheartedly in favor of free trade.</p>
