<p class="noindent">If the Internet started out both decentralized and democratic, why can’t we return to that state? I am under no illusion that this would be an easy process or that I have the correct strategy. I am not going to try to address the larger issue of whether robots and artificial intelligence are going to lead to a world without jobs, for that would take a book in itself. I have suggested that policy makers begin exploring a universal basic income, or UBI, a concept that has support on both the left and right. It does seem to me that to ignore the dystopian possibility that software will “eat the world” would be foolhardy. Just because some techno-optimists continue to insist that old jobs will be replaced by new jobs we can’t imagine yet does not mean it is true.</p>
<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-248"></a>Google’s AlphaGo artificial intelligence system may have bested the world’s greatest Go player, but I’m not worried that it’s going to replace our greatest musicians, filmmakers, and authors, even though an NYU artificial intelligence laboratory has programmed a robot named Benjamin to be a screenwriter. And even if you believe that robots will be able to fill most jobs, MIT’s Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson have pointed out that “understanding and addressing the societal challenges brought on by rapid technological progress remain tasks that no machine can do for us.” When I ask myself what it means to be human, I think that having empathy and the ability to tell stories rank high, and I am not worried that those skills will be replaced by AI. A great artist’s ability to inspire people—especially to compel them to think and act—lies at the heart of political and cultural change. It really is the reason we tell ourselves stories. Plato teaches us that we should not expect the arts and humanities to be driven or dominated by the objectives of science. In fact part of the liberal arts’ enduring mission is precisely to critique those objectives.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At the very beginning of this book, I wrote about computer scientists such as Alan Kay, who collaborated with many artists to make the Xerox Alto a tool that would “empower the artistic individual.” But somehow, in the years that followed, artists took a backseat to coders. So we will need the technology and creative communities to work together again to reengineer the Internet. If we return to the original vision of the World Wide Web as described by Tim Berners-Lee, I think we will be on the right track. In 2014, in the face of the extraordinary <a id="page-249"></a>consolidation of Internet power, Berners-Lee noted his concern about the “near-monopoly status” of Google and Facebook. His hope was that “by continually ‘re-decentralizing’ the web, we will unleash the next generation of technology, business and social innovators.” This requires both legal and business innovation, and it is those innovations to which we turn our attention.</p>
