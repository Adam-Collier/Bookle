<p class="noindent">The New Camaldoli Hermitage perches 1,300 feet above the Pacific in Big Sur, California, and is void of cellular service, Wi-Fi, and all other electronic conveniences. For my sixty-eighth birthday, inspired by a little book by Pico Iyer, <em class="calibre2">The Art of Stillness: Adventures in Going Nowhere,</em> I gave myself the gift of time and peace at this Benedictine <a id="page-226"></a>retreat. Aside from the chanting of the monks in the chapel, no words are spoken there—which is of course the point. At home I am just as guilty as anyone of trying to watch TV, check my email, and talk on the phone at the same time. But I think we all have to take vacations from our devices.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In my three days with the monks, I learned that the Benedictines believe that life revolves around five practices.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bl-list">• Prayer: This can be any daily silent practice or meditation.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Work: This becomes part of a balanced life. It cannot be the whole focus.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Study: This is when we read the wisdom of those who came before us.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Hospitality: This just means treating those around you with kindness; it can also mean breaking bread with friends.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Renewal: This is accomplished by taking one day a week to turn away from daily cares (and screens) and appreciate the natural beauty around us.</p></div>
<p class="calibre5">I am not Catholic, yet I find the monks’ prescriptions to be helpful, a model of how I want to live in the world. The idea of an examined life is missing in our current digital rush. Perhaps following the monks’ example of devotion to their community would be too much of a sacrifice for most of us, but when I was immersed in their fourteenth-century songs my mind kept wandering to the events that had occurred two weeks before in Charleston, South Carolina, <a id="page-227"></a>where nine church parishioners were killed by a racist kid named Dylann Roof. When you think that the families of the slain churchgoers were able to forgive the shooter, you can only marvel at the power of their faith. Never was the difference between community cooperation and individual separation more starkly outlined. I’m not sure my faith would afford me that amount of grace in the face of such evil, but I am awed to see it exist in this hateful political climate we inhabit. I kept thinking of how powerful this sense of community was.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The great biologist E. O. Wilson makes the argument in <em class="calibre2">The Social Conquest of Earth</em> that evolution favors humans who learn how to cooperate. Some of our prehistoric ancestors went out to hunt, while others stayed and kept the fire going. If everyone went out to hunt for his or her own food, there would be no fire over which to cook it when the hunters got back. This is why I have no truck with the arguments of Peter Thiel and his fellow Ayn Rand acolytes, who believe that “if any civilization is to survive, it is the morality of altruism that men have to reject.” Right now we are inundated with Silicon Valley propaganda about surviving in “the shark tank”—we idolize the take-no-prisoners entrepreneur who will stop at nothing to build his company. The biologist Frans de Waal describes how Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling destroyed his own company.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">An avowed admirer of Richard Dawkins’ gene-centric view of evolution, Skilling mimicked natural selection by ranking his employees on a one-to-five scale representing <a id="page-228"></a>the best (one) to the worst (five). Anyone with a ranking of five got axed, but not without first having been humiliated on a website featuring his or her portrait. Under this so-called “Rank &amp; Yank” policy, people proved perfectly willing to slit one another’s throats, resulting in a corporate atmosphere marked by appalling dishonesty within and ruthless exploitation outside the company.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Since at least 1995, professors at business schools have dismissed this kind of behavior as a natural outgrowth of the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter’s notion of “creative destruction.” The growth of the tech economy with its constant change would create a new kind of employee: oriented to the short term and focused on potential ability rather than acquired knowledge. But most of us are like Epicurus or even the monks of Camaldoli. We need a life narrative in which we take pride in being good at a specific task, and we value the experiences we have lived through.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Many of my colleagues on the faculty of USC certainly approach their work with this reverence for knowledge, but their students have new pressures on them to adopt the culture of creative destruction. They are expected to get a well-paying job the minute they leave college. No more thoughts of bumming around Europe for a year before you “get serious.” And the reason for this is the specter of debt that hangs over the head of most middle-class college kids. In 1970 the University of California raised the tuition for in-state students to $150 a year. Today the in-state tuition is $13,500. The effect of the average student debt of $30,000 <a id="page-229"></a>upon graduation is to increase the pressure to get a good job. As economist Joseph Stiglitz has written, “On average, many college graduates will search for months before they find a job—often only after having taken one or two unpaid internships. And they count themselves lucky, because they know that their poorer counterparts, some of whom did better in school, cannot afford to spend a year or two without income, and do not have the connections to get an internship in the first place.” And at least from the vantage point of a California college, getting a job seems to mean work in the technology sector. Back East, that probably means a job on Wall Street. In essence our universities are being turned into trade schools. Are we abandoning the humanities and a basic liberal arts education for the sake of preparing students for the careers that await them in Silicon Valley or on Wall Street?</p>
<p class="calibre5">The liberal arts and the humanities matter because, as the Greeks in Epicurus’s time would say, without art we have no empathy. The ancient Greeks used the word <em class="calibre2">catharsis</em> to mean the purification of emotions through art that results in renewal and restoration. The cultural critic Leon Wieseltier notes, “By creating sympathy, art lays the ground, the internal condition, for moral behavior.” I’ve been lucky enough to experience these feelings of catharsis many times—in concerts by Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan; in movies by Stanley Kubrick, David Lean, and Martin Scorsese. I felt it reading <em class="calibre2">To Kill a Mockingbird</em> as a teenager. My guess is that you, too, have felt the emotional renewal of art on many occasions. But there are periods (perhaps the present one) when the desire to spark catharsis <a id="page-230"></a>slips into the background and performers find themselves faced with more commercial pressures.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In his seminal 1976 work, <em class="calibre2">The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism,</em> Harvard sociologist Daniel Bell contended that modern capitalism creates a culture of such self-gratification and narcissism that it may end up causing its own destruction. This idea seems like a perfect way to think about DigiTour. DigiTour is a sixty-city concert tour of the six most popular YouTube stars. In 2015, they sold more than 220,000 tickets, mostly to girls between the ages of nine and fifteen. At points the din from the screaming fans gets so loud that the security guards stuff Kleenex in their ears. This, of course, is an American ritual, perhaps starting with the appearance of Frank Sinatra at New York’s Paramount Theatre in December of 1942. Jack Benny commented, “I thought the goddamned building was going to cave in. I never heard such a commotion.… All this for a fellow I never heard of.” In 1956 Elvis Presley drew similar screaming crowds, and of course in 1964, Beatlemania swept across the country.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But at DigiTour, something was different—the “talent” didn’t sing or dance at all. As <em class="calibre2">BuzzFeed</em> noted: “By and large, the cast do not really perform so much as appear. Roughly once every show, a booming voice prods, ‘Now, let’s—take—some—SELFIEEEES,’ in the way another announcer might implore a crowd to make some noise. The fans oblige.” The biggest star on YouTube is PewDiePie, who has more YouTube followers than Beyoncé. There are thirteen billion views of his videos, which feature him playing (and exaggeratingly reacting to) video games. That is <a id="page-231"></a>the new talent. I’m sure it has nothing to do with catharsis or any of the roles art has played in our lives throughout history.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The Internet revolution was supposed to usher in a new age of digital democracy, opening up distribution pipelines to anyone with talent. But what are we to make of a teenage phenom whose sole talent is playing a video game? The famous infinite monkey theorem posits that if you let enough monkeys type for a long enough time they will eventually write <em class="calibre2">Hamlet</em>. But have the four hundred hours of video uploaded to YouTube <em class="calibre2">every minute</em> produced the new Scorsese or Coppola? Could it be that the economics of “more” is drowning us in a sea of mediocrity?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course there are those who hold on to the notion that we are living in a golden age of television. But it must be noted that all the great programs usually cited as proof—<em class="calibre2">The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Walking Dead, True Detective</em>—exhibit a dark tone of nihilism that may perfectly match what the cultural theorist Jacques Barzun calls our age of decadence: “The forms of art as of life seem exhausted, the stages of development have been run through. Institutions function painfully. Repetition and frustration are the inevitable result. Boredom and fatigue are great historical forces.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now, my USC colleague Henry Jenkins, the great cultural critic, has another take on this, and I owe it to you to give you his opinion on the current state of TV:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">I do think [these dark dramas] may also have some sociological significance since what is being questioned here most <a id="page-232"></a>persistently is a certain kind of white masculinity—which emerges here as in crisis. The power of old institutions seems to be in decline, certain kinds of privilege is being questioned, certain hypocrisies are no longer tolerated. These stories can be read by white men as speaking to their decline from power and from other groups as representing a critique of traditional power structures. The ambivalence associated with the anti-hero speaks in both ways, and thus, the dual address itself reflects the fragmentation and discontent at the center of the American dream today.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">So this notion of an antihero who breaks all the rules and gets away with it (Don Draper, Tony Soprano) is dominant, but Jenkins notes that there is another, more hopeful set of TV genres, one that counters the decline of white male:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">So, we have stories of bright young women, especially women of color, trying to achieve success in their chosen fields, often modeling different kinds of support structures, often pushing back against structural racism, often dealing with their own self-doubts, as a contrast to the swaggering, but ultimately, flawed powerful white men. And then we have stories of teams that work together for the public good [police procedurals], often facing limited resources and moral ambiguities, but at heart, as a group, following a code of ethics and a rational process that arrives at sound answers.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Jenkins may be right that the golden age of television is real and sustainable, but I still think the winner-takes-all <a id="page-233"></a>economics of other media, including music, film, books, and journalism, will eventually break the TV business. As the FX network CEO, John Landgraf, pointed out, “There is simply too much television. We’re in the late stages of a bubble.” I was lucky enough to have dinner with the late William Paley in the mid-1980s. Paley had founded CBS and run it for more than fifty years, and he told me that owning a broadcast TV station in the 1960s was “a license to print money.” A top show could regularly get an audience of forty million viewers on a single night. In its final season, in 2015, <em class="calibre2">Mad Men</em> was lucky to get 1.7 million viewers. Who knows how many people watch <em class="calibre2">Mozart in the Jungle,</em> Amazon’s Golden Globe–winning drama? My guess is it’s less than a million. The production costs of a one-hour drama have never really fallen, even though the audience has declined by 80 percent. The law of diminishing returns in an era of proliferating production (especially from Amazon, YouTube Red, and Netflix) will eventually cause a crash.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But the wizards at Google, Facebook, and Amazon assure us that data will prevent the crash. Bloomberg, summarizing a report from JP Morgan Chase, wrote, “Whoever has the most data comes out on top, and the value of metadata will shift from content distribution to actual production.” Perhaps, but if the music business is any guide, this is a dead end. The business has become a song machine, as John Seabrook points out in his book of the same title. Seabrook attributes the uniformity of pop tunes to the use of data, which pushes producers toward the “track and hook” songwriting method now in vogue, especially in hip-hop and dance music.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara"><a id="page-234"></a>In a track-and-hook song, the hook comes as soon as possible. Then the song “vamps”—progresses in three-or-four chord patterns with little or no variation. Because it is repetitive, the vamp requires more hooks: intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, and outro hooks. “It’s not enough to have one hook anymore,” Jay Brown explains. “You’ve got to have a hook in the intro, a hook in the pre, a hook in the chorus, and a hook in the bridge, too.” The reason, he went on, is that people on average give a song seven seconds on the radio before they change the channel, and you got to hook them.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Now, if the major record labels were pouring more of the proceeds from the song machine into fostering new talent rather than making more factory-produced pop, we might find ourselves in a time of artistic renewal. Jacques Barzun, writing about the Renaissance, noted that prolific periods of creativity show up in history for relatively short periods of time and then disappear. So perhaps we are just in a creative interregnum—one in which the machine has taken over for the artist. And another renaissance will come again.</p>
