<p class="noindent">The ideas of Ayn Rand have not only inspired men like Thiel, they have also found a home in the highest political <a id="page-73"></a>offices in the country. Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, told the <em class="calibre2">Weekly Standard,</em> “I give out <em class="calibre2">Atlas Shrugged</em> as Christmas presents, and I make all my interns read it.” In a video series, Ryan said, “Ayn Rand, more than anyone else, did a fantastic job of explaining the morality of capitalism, the morality of individualism, and this, to me, is what matters most.” But as Paul Krugman has written, the Republican elite is “too committed to an Ayn Rand story line about heroic job creators versus moochers to admit either that trickle-down economics can fail to deliver good jobs, or that sometimes government aid is a crucial lifeline.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">The notion of altruism and cooperation is not something that Peter Thiel believes in. He is as confident as an Ayn Rand hero that “achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life.” He is not just a good businessman; it’s worth noting that at Stanford he earned his degree in philosophy, not in business. From the start, PayPal was pitched as a libertarian philosophy project, an effort to disrupt the credit card–banking system by offering an alternative way to make online payments. PayPal was also committed from the outset to avoiding government intrusion: Thiel does not believe in regulation, paying taxes, or guarding copyright. In addition, PayPal spawned a number of start-ups run by the young men of the PayPal Mafia, who founded YouTube, LinkedIn, Yelp, Palantir, and many other companies.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s important to understand that while libertarian philosophy may have been regarded as a fringe movement in American politics, epitomized by Ron Paul followers, it has become the mainstream economic philosophy for both <a id="page-74"></a>Silicon Valley and the Republican Party, thanks to the Koch brothers. The libertarian belief that the supremacy of the free market is the natural order of things is in reality nothing more than an “imagined order,” which the historian Yuval Noah Harari defines in his book <em class="calibre2">Sapiens</em> as the shared myths we use to induce cooperation. “In order to safeguard an imagined order,” Harari writes, “continuous and strenuous efforts are imperative.” Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” is no more a law of nature or physics than Moses’s Ten Commandments.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course Thiel’s comment about capitalism and democracy being incompatible points to an even darker part of the libertarian cult that Charles Koch flirted with, sometimes known as anarcho-capitalism or paleo-libertarianism. Its two main philosophers are Murray Rothbard and Hans-Hermann Hoppe. Hoppe wrote a book called <em class="calibre2">Democracy: The God That Failed,</em> which makes the argument that we need to return to a more authoritarian form of government. Here is Hoppe’s thesis:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">In the United States, less than a century of full-blown democracy has resulted in steadily increasing moral degeneration, family and social disintegration, and cultural decay in the form of continually rising rates of divorce, illegitimacy, abortion and crime. As a result of an ever-expanding list of non-discrimination—“affirmative action”—laws and non-discriminatory, multicultural, egalitarian immigration policies, every nook and cranny of American society is affected by government management and forced integration; accordingly, social strife and racial ethnic <a id="page-75"></a>and moral-cultural tension and hostility have increased dramatically.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">That a country in such peril would need a more authoritarian government that could counter the forces of “egalitarian immigration” and “forced integration” feels at once like a throwback to the Jim Crow 1950s and a contemporary statement from someone like Donald Trump. This is in essence the truly elitist theory behind Peter Thiel’s thinking. Though his undergraduate degree was in philosophy, Thiel gravitated toward technology and politics. What he believed was that politics was impeding progress and that he needed to find a way to make money without its interference. He wrote in his manifesto on the Cato Institute’s website:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">In our time, the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms—from the totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes to the unthinking demos that guides so-called “social democracy”.… We are in a deadly race between politics and technology.… The fate of our world may depend on the effort of a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Clearly he saw himself as the person to lead this crusade. He would create a business sector free from taxes, regulation, and copyright that would take the foundation laid down by Doug Engelbart, Stewart Brand, and Tim Berners-Lee in a whole new direction.</p>
