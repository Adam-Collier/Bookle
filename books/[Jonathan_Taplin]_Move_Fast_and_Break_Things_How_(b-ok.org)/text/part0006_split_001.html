<p class="noindent">The beginnings of the technical and social revolution that Martin Luther King referenced in his 1968 sermon at the National Cathedral were under way even as he was speaking. The revolution began in the moral precepts of the counterculture: decentralize control and harmonize people. The earliest networks—like the Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link (WELL), organized by Stewart Brand, the founder of <em class="calibre2">The Whole Earth Catalog</em>—grew directly out of 1960s counterculture. Brand had helped novelist Ken Kesey organize the Acid Tests—epic be-ins where thousands of hippies ingested LSD and danced to the music of a new band, the Grateful Dead. Steve Jobs, founder of Apple Computer, Inc., dropped acid as well. “Jobs explained,” wrote John Markoff in his book <em class="calibre2">What the Dormouse Said,</em> <a id="page-20"></a>“that he still believed that taking LSD was one of the two or three most important things he had done in his life, and he said he felt that because people he knew well had not tried psychedelics, there were things about him they couldn’t understand.” Brand, Kesey, and Jobs envisioned a new kind of network that was truly “bottom-up.” But our hopes that this new kind of network would overthrow political hierarchies and decrease inequality have turned out to be pipe dreams, the fantasies of digital utopians. A <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> article on a 2016 World Bank report noted, “Internet innovations stand to widen inequalities and even hasten the hollowing out of middle-class employment.” How did something so promising go so wrong? As the MIT researcher and early Internet pioneer Ethan Zuckerman wrote, “It’s obvious now that what we did was a fiasco, so let me remind you that what we wanted to do was something brave and noble.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">The original mission of the Internet was hijacked by a small group of right-wing radicals to whom the ideas of democracy and decentralization were anathema. By the late 1980s, starting with eventual PayPal founder Peter Thiel’s class at Stanford University, the dominant philosophy of Silicon Valley would be based far more heavily on the radical libertarian ideology of Ayn Rand than the commune-based principles of Ken Kesey and Stewart Brand. Thiel, who was also an early investor in Facebook and is the godfather of what he proudly calls the PayPal Mafia, which currently rules Silicon Valley, has been clear about his credo, stating, “I no longer believe that freedom and <a id="page-21"></a>democracy are compatible.” More important, Thiel says that if you want to create and capture lasting value, you should look to build a monopoly. Three of the companies that have played the largest role in imperiling artists are clear monopolies. Google has an 88 percent market share in online searches and search advertising. Google’s Android mobile operating system has an 80 percent global market share in its category. Amazon has a 70 percent market share in ebook sales. Facebook has a 77 percent market share in mobile social media. The fourth firm, Apple, is not a monopoly because its main hardware business has many competitors. Apple has a role to play in this story, but I will focus on the three digital monopolies that have done the most to alter the relationship between artists and those who support their work.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Perhaps not since the day of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil has a single company dominated a market as Google does. While Google and Facebook use their market power to extract monopoly rents from advertisers that are often 20 percent higher than market price, Amazon uses its monopsony (a market structure in which only one buyer interacts with many would-be sellers) to force authors, publishers, and booksellers to lower their prices, putting many of them out of business. This was not the decentralization that the founders of the Internet imagined, but ironically it was the very design of the Internet, with a set of global standards that allowed for massive scale, that led to the winner-takes-all economy of the Internet age.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In another time, Google, Facebook, and Amazon <a id="page-22"></a>would have been subject to government strictures and might be half the size they are now because much of their growth has been through acquisition, which would have been prevented by strict antitrust-law enforcement. Running for president in 1912, Woodrow Wilson said, “If monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of the government. What we have to determine now is whether we are big enough, whether we are men enough, whether we are free enough, to take possession again of the government which is our own.” But the antiregulatory religion pushed by libertarian think tanks since the Reagan era has gutted antitrust enforcement efforts in both Republican and Democratic administrations. As former secretary of labor Robert Reich wrote in 2015, “Big Tech has been almost immune to serious antitrust scrutiny, even though the largest tech companies have more market power than ever. Maybe that’s because they’ve accumulated so much political power.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even the investment bank Goldman Sachs finds itself perplexed by the extraordinary margins these monopolies are generating. In the standard model of capitalism, super-high-profit businesses encourage new competitors to enter the market, eventually forcing profits to normalize (economists call this mean reversion). A Goldman Sachs report says, “We are always wary of guiding for mean reversion. But, if we are wrong and high margins manage to endure for the next few years (particularly when global demand growth is below trend), there are broader questions to be asked about the efficacy of capitalism.” Coming from the premier investment bank on Wall Street, <a id="page-23"></a>this idea that capitalism is no longer working is quite an amazing statement.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This gets to the heart of our inquiry. Popular entertainment has had a “free” model, sponsored by advertising, since the dawn of radio in 1920. But companies like the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), which pioneered commercial broadcasting, always reinvested a large portion of their profits in the creation of content. Google, YouTube, and Facebook, by contrast, invest nothing in the creation of content—it’s all “user-generated,” even though much of it is professionally produced and appropriated by users. Even today CBS’s profit margin is 11 percent compared to Google’s 22 percent. That 11 percent advantage for Google represents potentially $8 billion not invested in content production.</p>
<p class="calibre5"><em class="calibre2">The Economist</em> reported in 2016 that “an American firm that was very profitable in 2003 (one with post-tax returns on capital of 15–25%, excluding goodwill) had an 83% chance of still being very profitable in 2013; the same was true for firms with returns of over 25%, according to McKinsey, a consulting firm. In the previous decade the odds were about 50%. The obvious conclusion is that the American economy is too cozy for incumbents.” The power of incumbency also limits the number of new start-up businesses, which have historically been the source of American job growth. New research by MIT economists Scott Stern and Jorge Guzman shows that “even as the number of new ideas and potential for innovation is increasing, there seems to be a reduction in the ability of companies to <a id="page-24"></a>scale in a meaningful and systematic way. It has become increasingly advantageous to be an incumbent, and less advantageous to be a new entrant.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">In 2013, Balaji Srinivasan, now a partner at the venture-capital company Andreessen Horowitz, claimed that Silicon Valley was becoming more powerful than Wall Street and the US government. He noted, “We want to show what a society run by Silicon Valley would look like. That’s where ‘exit’ comes in.… It basically means: build an opt-in society, ultimately outside the US, run by technology. And this is actually where the Valley is going. This is where we’re going over the next ten years.… [Google cofounder] Larry Page, for example, wants to set aside a part of the world for unregulated experimentation.” This is not just a libertarian fantasy. This is where Peter Thiel and Larry Page want to take the world. Thiel has financially supported an idea called seasteading, which is the concept of creating permanent artificial islands, called seasteads, outside the territory claimed by any government. These cloud businesses could thereby escape taxation and regulation. Page has financed extensive research on privately owned city-states. But President Obama has cautioned the Silicon Valley leaders, saying:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Sometimes we get, I think, in the tech community, the entrepreneurial community, the sense of—we just have to blow up the system, or create this parallel society and culture because government is inherently wrecked. No, it’s not inherently wrecked; it’s just government has to care for, for example, veterans who come home. That’s not on <a id="page-25"></a>your balance sheet, that’s on our collective balance sheet, because we have a sacred duty to take care of those veterans. And that’s hard and it’s messy, and we’re building up legacy systems that we can’t just blow up.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">But this sense of shared social responsibility is not part of the libertarian creed, which in many respects is antidemocratic. As Ben Tarnoff, writing in the <em class="calibre2">Guardian</em> noted, one of the reasons Peter Thiel was drawn to Donald Trump’s authoritarian candidacy was that “he would discipline what Thiel calls ‘the unthinking demos’: the democratic public that constrains capitalism.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">But for now there are few constraints on Tech capitalism. The monopoly profits of this new era have been very, very good to a few men. The Forbes 400 list, which ranks American wealth, places Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin, and Mark Zuckerberg in the top ten. The Silicon Valley venture capitalist Paul Graham (CEO of Y Combinator), in a 2016 blog post, was quite open about celebrating income inequality. He wrote, “I’ve become an expert on how to increase economic inequality, and I’ve spent the past decade working hard to do it. Not just by helping the 2500 founders YC has funded. I’ve also written essays encouraging people to increase economic inequality and giving them detailed instructions showing how.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">If tech billionaires have achieved political and economic power unseen since the Gilded Age, they have also achieved cultural power. David Nasaw, Andrew Carnegie’s biographer, has said, “Carnegie could never have <a id="page-26"></a>imagined the kind of power Zuckerberg has. Politics today is less relevant than it has ever been in our entire history. These CEOs are more powerful than they’ve ever been. The driving force of social change today is no longer government at all.” And the libertarian ideology of Silicon Valley has seeped its way into pop culture. As the <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em> film critic A. O. Scott pointed out, in our current fascination with superhero movies,</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">the genre’s default ideology is a variant of the masters-of-the-universe libertarianism that energizes some of the most vocal sectors of the American ruling class. The supermen are doing good, and they know what’s good for us, and they have never needed pusillanimous institutions—the cops, the press, the government—to tell them what to do. What they need is the support and gratitude of the masses, and when they don’t get that affirmation, they can get a little sulky.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page want our gratitude because they would have us believe they’ve delivered a period of unprecedented innovation that will inevitably improve not just their lives but also the lives of all the earth’s citizens. But is this true? Statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) tell another tale: economic growth is dramatically slowing while inequality in developed countries is increasing. Unlike the years of more than 6 percent growth spurred by twentieth-century innovation cycles (electricity, communication, transportation), the digital revolution is <a id="page-27"></a>delivering less than 2 percent growth and increasing inequality in the developed world. As economist Paul Krugman notes, reviewing Robert Gordon’s <em class="calibre2">The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living Since the Civil War,</em> “Gordon suggests that the future is all too likely to be marked by stagnant living standards for most Americans, because the effects of slowing technological progress will be reinforced by a set of ‘headwinds’: rising inequality, a plateau in education levels, an aging population and more.” If in fact profits are accruing to increasingly dominant tech-industry monopolies, a process that is eliminating middle-class jobs (think robots and self-driving truck fleets), we can see that the techno-determinist path will ultimately lead to deep social unrest.</p>
