<p class="noindent">I was lucky enough to live and work in the midst of a couple of renaissance moments in the 1960s music business with Bob Dylan and The Band and George Harrison. And then starting in 1974 I was a producer in Hollywood at a <a id="page-235"></a>time when a revolutionary group of young filmmakers—including Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Paul Schrader—had both the “feverish interest” and the appetite for rivalry to remake the film business. From the point of view of old Hollywood, the lunatics had taken over the asylum, and an extraordinary creativity reigned. It all lasted around six years, then the suits took control again. But in the interim, what glorious films they were: <em class="calibre2">The Godfather, American Graffiti, MASH, Nashville, Taxi Driver, Jaws, Five Easy Pieces, Shampoo, The Last Picture Show, Mean Streets, The French Connection,</em> and <em class="calibre2">Badlands,</em> to name just a few. Those of us involved in this American New Wave will treasure those years forever. By 1980, the music and the film businesses had both migrated to the blockbuster model epitomized by Michael Jackson’s <em class="calibre2">Thriller</em> and George Lucas’s <em class="calibre2">Star Wars</em>. It was as if the entire lineup of a baseball team was expected to hit home runs instead of singles and doubles.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What made this extraordinary period possible? To begin with, it came on the heels of a crash. The movie business in the late 1960s was dominated by five family-owned firms that were in only one line of business—the production and distribution of movies. Warner Bros. was owned by Jack Warner, 20th Century Fox was controlled by the Zanuck family, and Columbia Pictures was run by the Schneider family. United Artists was owned by Arthur Krim, and Paramount was still controlled by the nonagenarian Adolph Zukor. As the TV business got more successful, movie attendance continued to drop. By the early <a id="page-236"></a>1960s the movie business was in crisis. In an attempt to grow their audience, the studios produced a series of spectacles and musicals. Although these films were not too different from the standard fare, they were much more expensive. Films like <em class="calibre2">Cleopatra, Paint Your Wagon, The Molly Maguires,</em> and others were huge flops, and by 1969 most of the studios were teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. In the midst of this chaos a young man named Bert Schneider persuaded his older brother Stanley, who ran Columbia Pictures, to give him $360,000 so he could make a hippie motorcycle road movie. Released in early 1969, <em class="calibre2">Easy Rider</em> completely changed the industry. The film grossed more than $60 million, so the return on investment was extraordinary. Almost instantly, every broke studio began looking for first-time directors who could make films for less than $1 million.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The obvious place to look was the film schools—NYU, USC, and UCLA. But the young men (and they were almost all men) who were training in these schools had a very different view of the role of the director from that of the old moguls who still ran the studios. The kids had been schooled on European New Wave directors such as François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Federico Fellini, and Ingmar Bergman. In Europe, the director was the auteur of the film, both legally and in spirit. After the success of <em class="calibre2">Easy Rider,</em> the film’s director, Dennis Hopper, asked for and received final cut privilege—i.e., the right to decide what is and isn’t included in the version of the film released to the public—and that became standard procedure at <a id="page-237"></a>Bert Schneider’s company, BBS, which went on to make <em class="calibre2">Five Easy Pieces</em> with Bob Rafelson and <em class="calibre2">The Last Picture Show</em> with Peter Bogdanovich. All this required a new kind of executive who could be sensitive to the needs of this new kind of filmmaker. Arthur Penn, who made <em class="calibre2">Bonnie and Clyde</em> for Warner Bros., tells the story of an old Jack Warner trying to understand a new generation. Warren Beatty, the star and producer of the film, went with Penn to Jack Warner’s house to screen it for him. Warner said, just before the lights went down, “If I have to get up and pee, you know the picture stinks.” Twenty minutes in, Warner got up and peed. When it was all over, he turned to Penn and Beatty and said, “What the hell is this? Where are the good guys?” He hated the picture, but having sunk $2.5 million into it, he allowed Beatty to roll it out in what was known as an art-house release. This meant opening it in a few theaters in key cities and hoping the critics and word of mouth would get the film noticed. Penn and Beatty were able to get strong support from the critics, and Warner’s $2.5 million investment turned into a $70 million box-office return.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This brief respite from the economic doldrums allowed Warner to sell out to Seven Arts and then to Steve Ross, the owner of Kinney National Services, a parking-lot and janitorial business. But Ross was smart and realized that he needed a new breed of manager to run a creative business. He hired the talent agent Ted Ashley and the producer John Calley to run Warner Bros. Pictures. In many ways Calley followed the model of Mo Ostin, who ran <a id="page-238"></a>Warner Bros. Records (see <a href="part0007_split_002.html#page-39">here</a>) for Ross. The record guys called it A and R—artists and repertoire. That’s what you had to pay attention to. Keep the artists happy, and make sure the songs and scripts (repertoire) are of the highest quality. For example, the first half hour of the meeting Martin Scorsese and I had with John Calley after he bought our movie <em class="calibre2">Mean Streets</em> was spent talking about Miles Davis, a mutual enthusiasm for the three of us. Calley’s office furniture consisted of two long suede sofas surrounding an Eames chair and ottoman, where Calley sat—not a desk in sight. The idea was to break down the hierarchy, and it worked. We left Calley’s office feeling like we had been admitted to a secret society.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Artist-friendly management was only part of the deal. The secret sauce was frugality. Most of the movies I cited in connection with this renaissance were made for around $1 million. Even the epic film of the era, <em class="calibre2">The Godfather,</em> only cost $6 million. Given that <em class="calibre2">Cleopatra,</em> filmed ten years earlier, had cost $37 million, <em class="calibre2">The Godfather</em> was a bargain for Paramount. The trade-off was artistic freedom in return for budgetary restraint. Very few directors have final cut privilege anymore, because the very idea of asking a studio to give you $100 million and then telling the suits they have no say in the film is beyond the pale, even for the most inflated Hollywood egos. And because budgets were smaller and artists had more freedom in the 1970s, the films inevitably traversed into the realms of politics, sex, and power as opposed to the power of a superhero in a fantasy universe. This was of course quite edifying for a generation who came of age with the Pill and the <a id="page-239"></a>assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert Kennedy, not to mention the Vietnam War. The artists working on a low budget on the margins of the culture are usually those who advance their art. Orson Welles’s budget for <em class="calibre2">Citizen Kane</em> was $800,000, just two years after MGM had spent nearly $4 million on <em class="calibre2">Gone with the Wind</em>. It is universally acknowledged that <em class="calibre2">Kane</em> advanced the art of cinema and was the greater picture. The big studios have pretty much abandoned those marginal artists and their aspirations and now concentrate their capital and their minds on “franchises”—endlessly duplicatable comic books that can be built to a formula and require a traffic cop rather than an auteur.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What was most remarkable about that brief period from 1969 to 1979 was the collegiality we enjoyed and shared with one another. The film-school generation read each other’s scripts, made casting suggestions, and sat in on rough-cut screenings. Of course there was rivalry, but—more important—there was also support. Francis Coppola, having seen an early cut of <em class="calibre2">Mean Streets,</em> suggested to Bernardo Bertolucci that he cast Robert De Niro in <em class="calibre2">1900,</em> told Ellen Burstyn to hire Martin Scorsese for <em class="calibre2">Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,</em> then cast De Niro in <em class="calibre2">The Godfather: Part II.</em> Paul Schrader came to an early <em class="calibre2">Mean Streets</em> screening and immediately called Michael Phillips, who had just won an Oscar for <em class="calibre2">The Sting,</em> and told him that Scorsese and De Niro would be perfect for his new script, <em class="calibre2">Taxi Driver</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Could it be that the extraordinary period in America between the arrival of Louis Armstrong and Charlie Chaplin in the early 1920s and the advent of the blockbuster in <a id="page-240"></a>1980 represents an unusually long renaissance that may not come this way again? In 1998, when the American Film Institute first published its list of the one hundred greatest films of all time, only thirteen of them were made after 1980. I’m not interested in nostalgia but rather in figuring out what changed. Perhaps Henry Jenkins is right: the neorealism that was so much a part of the American New Wave in the 1970s has drifted into TV. But TV has also spawned an age of reality shows in which Kim Kardashian and Donald Trump can overwhelm any cultural innovation that might exist.</p>
