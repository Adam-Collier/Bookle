<p class="noindent">The first “machinery of freedom” Thiel, Max Levchin, and Luke Noseck designed was PayPal. In his book <em class="calibre2">Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future,</em> Thiel notes proudly, “Of the six people who started PayPal, four had built bombs in high school.” Originally called Confinity, the company was started in December of 1998 as a payment system for the Palm Pilot handheld computer. The ambitious philosophy of PayPal is clearly stated in early remarks from Thiel: “It will be nearly impossible for corrupt governments to steal wealth from their people through their old means,” he once told his staff, “because if they try the people will switch to dollars or Pounds or Yen, in effect dumping the worthless local currency for something more secure.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">So from the basic Randian concept that governments cannot be trusted with currency, he moved on to set up the basic principles that would constitute the foundation for most new Internet fortunes.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="nl-list">1. Build a proprietary technology that has significant benefits over the competition. Thiel says, “It’s always a red flag when entrepreneurs talk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market.” He wanted to invest in monopolies, not competitive businesses.</p>
<p class="nl-list">2. Build businesses that have “network effects.” Thiel’s first two major investments, PayPal and Facebook, both benefit from having millions of users who want to connect with each other. When PayPal was just a <a id="page-77"></a>payment system for Palm Pilot, it was a failure. As soon as it became the standard payment system for eBay, it got the network-effect wind at its back.</p>
<p class="nl-list">3. Economies of scale are critical. Google is pretty much unassailable in search-engine advertising because it has huge economies of scale. This leads to the conclusion that there will be very few winners in each sector of tech. The combination of scale and network effects makes it very hard to dislodge the winners, especially if you are in a business like tech, which is so lightly regulated.</p>
<p class="nl-list">4. Branding becomes critical. The brand becomes a promise of value to consumers. Apple gets superior margins because of its brand promise for quality and elegant design. The brand promise also helps you defend yourself against government intrusion. Google’s original “Don’t be evil” brand promise gave them a patina of social entrepreneurship that helps protect them from accusations of monopoly power tactics.</p></div>
<p class="calibre5">As John Seely Brown has pointed out, the end of the decentralized Web that Engelbart and the PARC visionaries had imagined occurs at this point, when “we moved from products to platforms, which let the network effect play out in a hub and spoke model.” From this point on the economies of scale enjoyed by a platform whose users are measured in the billions becomes the ultimate metric for success. Thiel understood this, and from PayPal, the original founding group began to spread through Silicon Valley after eBay’s $1 billion acquisition of the company. Even <a id="page-78"></a>companies not funded by Thiel adopted his unique view of capitalism. The foundations of an Internet economy that operates with little regulation have been the basis of their fortunes.</p>
