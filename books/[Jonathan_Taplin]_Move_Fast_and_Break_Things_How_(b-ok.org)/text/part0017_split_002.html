<p class="noindent">In August of 2001, at the Federal Reserve Bank’s annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium, former treasury secretary Lawrence Summers and University of California economist J. Bradford DeLong delivered a paper on economic policy for the information economy. They began with a basic fact of digital economics: given that price equals marginal cost, “with information goods the social and marginal cost of distribution is close to zero.” <em class="calibre2">Marginal cost</em> means the cost of producing one more unit of a good. Once a song is on a Spotify server, the cost of selling one more stream is zero. But here is the paradox:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">If information goods are to be distributed at their marginal cost of production—zero—they cannot be created and produced by entrepreneurial firms that use revenues obtained from sales to consumers to cover their [fixed set-up] costs. If information goods are to be created and produced… [companies] must be able to anticipate selling their products at a profit to someone.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-250"></a>In this zero-marginal-cost economy, the only way to make money is to scrape consumer data from your users and sell it to advertisers. In the creative world, nowhere does the fixed cost to produce high-quality music, video, books, and games get factored into this equation. How are musicians, journalists, photographers, and filmmakers going to survive in the zero-marginal-cost economy? For the media economy to continue, we are going to have to find ways to deal with the paradox that Summers and DeLong point to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If zero marginal cost is the first economic fact, then the “law of large numbers” is the second one. At the Annenberg Innovation Lab, we believe that there will be at least five billion Internet-connected mobile devices in the world by 2018. If that’s true, and if you could sell a streaming movie for $1 to 5 percent of that market, it would mean revenue of $250 million for that movie. The law of large numbers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To see how that plays out in the rest of the market, try a little thought experiment with me. In 1998, the average yearly entertainment expenditure for movie tickets, event admissions, and other entertainment content costs for someone under twenty-five years of age in the United States was $393 (adjusted for inflation), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By 2012, that amount had declined to $249 per year because of all the free entertainment available from YouTube, pirate sites, and social media. So assume that the richest 10 percent of those five billion mobile users will spend what a teenager did in 1998—$28 per month. That would yield $170 billion in media revenue per year. Then assume the next 40 percent of mobile customers spend $10 per month—essentially a Netflix account. That <a id="page-251"></a>would yield $240 billion a year. Finally, assume that the poorest 40 percent of users get their slightly more limited content for free in return for watching ads worth $5 per month. That would yield an additional $120 billion per year. This would mean a media and entertainment economy <em class="calibre2">just on mobile devices</em> of $556 billion per year. Given that the global media and entertainment economy is only $1.3 trillion from all sources, you can see that the future would be bright if we could only figure out how to make sure the creators of content get paid for this bounty.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For the media economy, the implications of zero marginal cost and the law of large numbers—in addition to the ideas I have put forth about advertising, peak content, and winner takes all—are profound. I could imagine a TV system with no more than forty “linear” channels, most of which would consist of live sports and news. The remaining bandwidth would be devoted to a huge selection of on-demand Internet video content, equipped with efficient search and preference tools. Almost all of what we now consider TV would be delivered on demand. This would mean that the Internet monopolists could also control TV. But it also raises the larger question of how Internet video content would be paid for in a world where advertising funds Google and Facebook. Kalkis Research has a daunting view of the future of online advertising:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">The online advertising market is saturated, and has no more room to grow. The traditional space for ads is overcrowded, and has started to shrink, as Internet users start to use ad blockers.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara"><a id="page-252"></a>Controls and regulations are nonexistent, and a big chunk of ad spending is being stolen, plain and simple. Customers are growing aware of the phenomenon of ad fraud. Every new fraud scandal bears the risk of customers scaling back on online ad spending. The whole ecosystem is at risk of turning from growth to decline, overnight, in a rerun of what happened in 2000–2001.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">If indeed two hundred million people currently use ad blockers and the distinction between TV and the Web is dissolving, then we need to rethink how content gets paid for. Tim Berners-Lee, the Web’s inventor, has an idea. “Ad revenue is the only model for too many people on the web now,” Berners-Lee told the <em class="calibre2">New York Times</em>. “People assume today’s consumer has to make a deal with a marketing machine to get stuff for ‘free,’ even if they’re horrified by what happens with their data. Imagine a world where paying for things was easy on both sides.” Berners-Lee speculates about a kind of micropayment system that would allow you easily to pay fifteen cents on your mobile bill for a piece of content. But until that is invented, my guess is that the most efficient model would be an all-you-can-watch subscription model that would not be too different from what you are paying now to your cable or telephone company. Essentially the carrier would bundle all these services across both fixed and mobile broadband. And because everything would be sent over the Internet, the cost of physical carriage and TV infrastructure would drop radically, so more money could flow to content creation. But to make that work, the current structure of Internet power must be reformed.</p>
<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-253"></a>The basic laws governing the Internet were passed in 1998, at a time when it took four hours to download a movie and twenty minutes to download a song. Those laws may have made sense in an era before broadband, but today no individual can effectively police copyright infringement. We should begin with the changes to the law that are easy to make, then work our way up to the hard stuff. It makes sense to start with the music business—the first to get decimated by the digital revolution. In an interview, the great music manager Irving Azoff (the Eagles) stated the problem:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">It’s very clear that the economics of streaming haven’t helped creators. And I don’t think that when President Clinton signed the law that led to safe harbor, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that there was any intention for the tech companies to hide behind it the way that they currently do.</p>
<p class="blockquote-indentedpara">None of us in the music business have enough resources to fight the legal battles against these big tech companies. The best thing would be to change laws.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">The DMCA “safe harbor” provisions that Google, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook hide behind need to be changed, as Azoff suggests. Every artist who has tried to have his work removed from an infringing website knows the problem. The rightful owner of the work files a takedown notice, the infringing site deletes the file temporarily, then the user reposts the same work using a different URL. This game of cat-and-mouse keeps the material available somewhere. Under current US law, this procedure is perfectly legal, and it is used by every pirate site (as well as YouTube) to avoid <a id="page-254"></a>prosecution. In the first twelve weeks of 2016, Google received takedown requests for 213 million links, representing a 125 percent increase over the same period in 2015. An amendment to the law needs to be written stating that once a takedown notice has been filed, it is the responsibility of the website to keep the content down (a system that some advocates are calling take down, stay down). Google complains that this would be technically hard to do, but we know the company has the automated tools that make it possible.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Google and YouTube are thinking ahead to a time when content creators may win the battle. They allow users to post anything on YouTube, citing the doctrine of fair use, which permits limited use of copyrighted material without the need to acquire permission from rights holders. Your local TV station can show a short highlight of a football game broadcast by another network under fair use. When you post something on YouTube, even if it is a whole song and even if you do not check the box that says “I own this piece of content,” you check the box that says “fair use,” and the content will go up. Google has made it very clear that it will increase the legal support it provides for its user communities so they can defend themselves against accusations of copyright infringement.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Academics and others who rely on quoting or otherwise using small portions of others’ works are very aware that there are real limitations to fair use. You cannot use a work in its entirety and claim fair use. Musicians and filmmakers could rely on the Content ID system YouTube currently has in place, but few have the wherewithal to deal with every takedown counterclaim that is asserted on <a id="page-255"></a>grounds of fair use. In a filing to the register of copyrights, Warner Music Group stated, “WMG estimates that currently, it would take at least 20–30 people, at a fully loaded cost in excess of $2 million per year, and probably the use of an outside content monitoring contactor at additional expense, to meaningfully affect (but not entirely block) just WMG’s top 25 album releases on YouTube.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">The solution to this stalemate is fairly simple. The Library of Congress should issue a set of guidelines to determine the precise definition of fair use. In academia, it usually means a video or audio clip cannot exceed thirty seconds and that it should be quoted in the context of some transformative work (such as a remix or mashup). The language USC uses is pretty clear:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Did the unlicensed use “transform” the material taken from the copyrighted work by using it for a different purpose than the original, or did it just repeat the work for the same intent and value as the original?</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre5">If the Library of Congress were to issue guidelines on fair use, then when a YouTube user uploads a clip (asserting fair use) of a piece of work that Content ID identifies as being blocked by the copyright holder, the clip would be sent to a human screener employed by YouTube for evaluation—the same way YouTube screens out pornography and ISIS videos. If the clip does not meet the Library of Congress guidelines, it would stay blocked.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The second area of administrative law that we need to deal with concerns the Federal Trade Commission, which is <a id="page-256"></a>in charge of regulating Internet advertising and data collection. Because Google and Facebook are mainly in the business of advertising and data collection, the FTC is really the most important regulatory agency. In the past, when the FTC has examined Google’s advertising business, it has rejected the charge brought by some consumers that Google collects monopoly rents because it controls 78 percent of the search-advertising business. The FTC’s rationale is that Google AdWords operates as an auction, so it can’t set premium prices. But as Google’s own AdWords blog points out, even if you were the only bidder on a given keyword, “the minimum CPC [cost per click] for a keyword is not related to the number of competitors one has for that keyword.” Google has a minimum threshold you need to meet in order for your ads to be able to show. Therefore, by setting minimum bids, Google is clearly able to charge monopoly rents.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But it is in the area of data collection where Facebook and Google are going to offer the most resistance. The FTC has been completely silent on this subject, in contrast to the European Union. The EU has raised the issue of what degree of control individuals have over their digital data, ranging from pictures on Facebook to Web searches and surfing habits stored by Google. The EU wants to allow individuals the power to delete their data, which Internet companies would otherwise store and monetize through targeted ads. Given that Google stores your complete search history, your location history, your purchase data, your demographic profile, your calendar, and your contacts, it would seem only logical that the FTC should consider a default option that asks if you want to opt in to data sharing.</p>
<p class="calibre5"><a id="page-257"></a>In addition, the FTC needs to investigate ad fraud. Following is the scope of the problem:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="bl-list">• As much as 50 percent of publisher traffic is bot activity—fake clicks from automated computing programs.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Bots account for 11 percent of display-ad views and 23 percent of video-ad views.</p>
<p class="bl-list">• Digital advertising will take in $43.8 billion in 2017, $6.3 billion of which will be based on fraudulent activity.</p></div>
<p class="calibre5">So who pays for the $6.3 billion in fraudulent ad charges? First the advertisers pay it, then they pass the cost on to consumers. Of course for Google and other Internet ad exchanges, it’s not their problem; it’s built into their business model. But as with every part of this puzzle, the ability to fix the problem is fairly simple. If a firm such as White Ops can tell the difference between bot views and human views, so can Google. We at the Annenberg Innovation Lab discovered this when we published a report on ad exchanges that send excess ad inventory to pirate sites to “liquidate.” Within months of being named as the worst offender, Google stopped most of the ads from landing on these sites.</p>
